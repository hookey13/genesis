  - "Proper financial data handling with Decimal"

final_recommendation: |
  The implementation demonstrates high-quality engineering with excellent architecture,
  comprehensive feature coverage, and production-ready patterns. However, the circular
  import issue is a critical blocker that prevents any testing verification.
  
  Once the circular import is resolved and tests pass, this story will achieve PASS
  status with an expected quality score of 9.5/10.
  
  The development team has done exceptional work on the implementation. The only
  issue appears to be a structural problem with the mock_exchange module that
  should be straightforward to fix.

next_steps:
  1: "Fix circular import immediately (est. 30 minutes)"
  2: "Run all tests and fix any failures (est. 1-2 hours)"
  3: "Add performance benchmarks (est. 2 hours)"
  4: "Re-run QA gate review for PASS status"
