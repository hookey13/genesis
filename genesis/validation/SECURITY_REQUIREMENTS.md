# Security Requirements for Production Deployment

## Critical Security Issues to Address Before Production

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

**Current State**: Demo implementation with placeholder authentication
**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Replace demo authentication in `decision.py` with proper bcrypt/scrypt/argon2
- [ ] Integrate with enterprise SSO/LDAP system
- [ ] Implement proper session management
- [ ] Add multi-factor authentication for override operations
- [ ] Store credentials in secure vault (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)

### 2. Password Security

**Current Issues**:
- Weak password hashing (SHA256) - MUST use bcrypt/scrypt/argon2
- Hardcoded credentials in code - MUST use environment variables or secure vault
- No password complexity requirements
- No account lockout mechanism

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Implement bcrypt with appropriate work factor (minimum 12)
- [ ] Add password complexity requirements
- [ ] Implement account lockout after failed attempts
- [ ] Add rate limiting for authentication attempts
- [ ] Implement password rotation policy

### 3. Audit Logging

**Current State**: Basic file-based logging
**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Implement tamper-proof audit logging
- [ ] Send audit logs to centralized SIEM
- [ ] Add log integrity verification
- [ ] Implement log retention policy
- [ ] Ensure PII is not logged

### 4. Deployment Security

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Implement deployment script signing
- [ ] Add deployment approval workflow
- [ ] Implement rollback authentication
- [ ] Add deployment environment isolation
- [ ] Implement secret rotation for deployment credentials

### 5. Data Protection

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- [ ] Implement TLS for all network communications
- [ ] Add data classification and handling policies
- [ ] Implement secure deletion of temporary files
- [ ] Add encryption for backup files

## Implementation Priority

1. **CRITICAL**: Fix authentication system before ANY production use
2. **HIGH**: Implement proper audit logging
3. **HIGH**: Secure deployment pipeline
4. **MEDIUM**: Enhance data protection
5. **MEDIUM**: Add monitoring and alerting

## Security Testing Requirements

Before production deployment, conduct:
- [ ] Security code review
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] OWASP Top 10 vulnerability assessment
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Security configuration review

## Compliance Requirements

Ensure compliance with:
- [ ] SOC 2 Type II requirements
- [ ] ISO 27001 standards
- [ ] Industry-specific regulations (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, etc.)
- [ ] Data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
