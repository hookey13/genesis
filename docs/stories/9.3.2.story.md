# Sub-Story 9.3.2: Vault Integration & Secret Migration

## Story Information
**Epic:** 9 - Critical Security & Infrastructure Hardening
**Parent Story:** 9.3 - HashiCorp Vault Integration for Secrets Management
**Sub-Story ID:** 9.3.2
**Status:** Done
**Priority:** Critical (P0)
**Estimated Effort:** 4 hours
**Dependencies:** 9.3.1 (Vault Deployment)

## User Story
As a security engineer,
I want to migrate all hardcoded secrets to Vault and integrate Vault with the application,
So that no sensitive credentials remain exposed in code or configuration files.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All hardcoded API keys migrated to Vault
2. Database credentials using dynamic secret generation
3. Application integrated with Vault client libraries
4. JWT signing keys managed through Vault
5. Envelope encryption for sensitive application data
6. Zero hardcoded secrets remaining in codebase
7. Secret rotation without service interruption
8. Emergency break-glass access procedures

## Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Application Integration (2 hours)
- [x] Integrate Vault client library with application
- [x] Create VaultManager for secret operations
- [x] Implement caching and retry logic
- [x] Add Vault authentication and token management
- [x] Create secret retrieval abstractions
- [x] Test Vault connectivity and failover

### Phase 2: Secret Migration (2 hours)
- [x] Identify all hardcoded secrets in codebase
- [x] Migrate API keys and credentials to Vault
- [x] Setup dynamic database credential generation
- [x] Configure envelope encryption for sensitive data
- [x] Remove all hardcoded secrets from code
- [x] Validate secret rotation procedures

## Definition of Done
- [x] All hardcoded secrets removed from codebase
- [x] Application successfully retrieving secrets from Vault
- [x] Dynamic database credentials operational
- [x] Envelope encryption protecting sensitive data
- [x] Secret rotation working without downtime
- [x] Emergency access procedures documented and tested

## Success Metrics
- Zero hardcoded secrets in security scan
- 100% secret operations using Vault
- <10ms secret retrieval performance
- 100% successful secret rotation operations

## Notes
This completes the critical security transformation from insecure hardcoded secrets to enterprise-grade secret management. Every secret must be verified as migrated before production deployment.

## Dev Notes

### Technical Context
- **Vault Client Library**: Use `hvac` Python library (v1.2.1+) for Vault integration
- **Authentication**: AppRole authentication for production, token for development
- **Secret Engines**: KV v2 for static secrets, database engine for PostgreSQL dynamic credentials
- **Caching Strategy**: 5-minute TTL for static secrets, no caching for dynamic credentials
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with 3 retries, circuit breaker after 5 consecutive failures

### File Structure
```
genesis/security/
├── vault_manager.py         # Core Vault client and operations
├── credential_manager.py    # Dynamic credential generation
├── secret_rotation.py      # Automated rotation logic
└── envelope_encryption.py  # Data encryption utilities

genesis/config/
└── vault_config.py         # Vault configuration and endpoints
```

### Integration Points
- **Database**: PostgreSQL connection using dynamic credentials from Vault
- **JWT**: Signing keys stored in Vault, rotated every 30 days
- **API Keys**: Third-party API keys in KV v2 with audit logging
- **Encryption**: Envelope encryption using Vault's transit engine

### Error Handling
- **Connection Failures**: Fallback to cached secrets with warning alerts
- **Token Expiry**: Automatic renewal 10 minutes before expiry
- **Secret Not Found**: Clear error message with break-glass procedure reference
- **Rotation Failures**: Alert security team, maintain old secret until resolved

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Mock Vault responses, test retry logic, validate caching
- **Integration Tests**: Real Vault instance in Docker, test all secret types
- **Security Tests**: Verify no secrets in logs, test audit trail, validate encryption
- **Performance Tests**: Secret retrieval <10ms, bulk operations <100ms
- **Failover Tests**: Simulate Vault outage, test cache fallback
