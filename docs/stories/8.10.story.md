# Story 8.10: Go-Live Readiness Checklist & Validation

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As the** system owner,
**I want** a comprehensive go-live checklist with automated validation using parallel development approach,
**So that** production deployment is risk-free, complete, and efficiently developed using Git worktrees.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Automated checklist validation with pass/fail status
2. Code quality gates (coverage, complexity, duplication)
3. Security validation (no secrets, vulnerabilities)
4. Performance benchmarks met (latency, throughput)
5. Documentation completeness check
6. Operational readiness (runbooks, alerts)
7. Legal and compliance sign-off tracking
8. Rollback plan tested and documented
9. Team training completion verification
10. Go/No-Go decision automation with override

## Dev Notes

### Validation Framework Structure
[Source: PRD Epic 8 - Story 8.10]

The validation framework must be located in `genesis/validation/` as per the source tree structure. Core implementation from PRD includes:

```python
# genesis/validation/go_live_validator.py
class GoLiveValidator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.checks = self._define_checks()
        self.results: List[ValidationCheck] = []
```

### Technical Validation Requirements
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

- **Test Framework:** pytest 8.0.0 with pytest-asyncio
- **Coverage Requirements:** 
  - 100% for money paths (risk_engine, executor, math utils)
  - 90% for risk/tilt modules
  - 70% for UI/analytics
- **Test Organization:** tests/unit/, tests/integration/, tests/fixtures/

### Security Requirements
[Source: architecture/security.md]

Security validation must check:
- Input validation on all external data
- API key encryption using Fernet/AES-256
- No hardcoded secrets in codebase
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- OWASP security testing integration

### Performance Benchmarks
[Source: PRD Epic 8]

- **Latency:** P99 must be <50ms
- **Load Testing:** Handle 100x normal load
- **Stability:** 48-hour continuous operation without crashes
- **Memory:** No memory leaks detected over extended runs

### Infrastructure Requirements
[Source: architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md]

- **Deployment Strategy:** Blue-green deployment
- **Rollback RTO:** <5 minutes for critical issues
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus + Grafana required
- **Environments:** Paper trading must run 48 hours before production

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

New files to create:
- `genesis/validation/` - Main validation module
- `genesis/validation/__init__.py` - Module initialization
- `genesis/validation/orchestrator.py` - Validation orchestrator

- `genesis/validation/business/` - Business validators
- `tests/unit/test_validation.py` - Unit tests
- `tests/integration/test_go_live_validation.py` - Integration tests

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

- Test files must follow pattern: `test_{module}.py`
- Unit tests in `tests/unit/` mirroring source structure
- Integration tests in `tests/integration/`
- Use pytest fixtures in `tests/conftest.py`
- Mock external dependencies with pytest-mock
- Test data in `tests/fixtures/`

## Testing

### Test Requirements
- Unit tests with 100% coverage for all validator classes
- Integration tests for full validation pipeline
- Performance tests for validation execution time
- Mock external dependencies (git, pytest, docker)
- Test both passing and failing validation scenarios

### Test File Locations
- `tests/unit/test_validation_framework.py`
- `tests/unit/test_quality_validators.py`
- `tests/unit/test_security_validators.py`
- `tests/unit/test_operational_validators.py`
- `tests/unit/test_business_validators.py`
- `tests/integration/test_go_live_validation.py`

### Testing Frameworks
- pytest 8.0.0 for test execution
- pytest-asyncio for async validators
- pytest-mock for mocking external tools
- faker for generating test validation data
- VCR.py for recording external API responses

## Git Worktree Setup Instructions

To work on these stories in parallel, developers should set up Git worktrees:

```bash
# From main repository
cd /path/to/genesis

# Create worktrees for parallel development
git worktree add -b feature/story-8-10-1-validation-framework ../genesis-8-10-1
git worktree add -b feature/story-8-10-2-quality-gates ../genesis-8-10-2
git worktree add -b feature/story-8-10-3-security-compliance ../genesis-8-10-3

# After Set 1 completes, create Set 2 worktrees
git worktree add -b feature/story-8-10-4-operational-validators ../genesis-8-10-4
git worktree add -b feature/story-8-10-5-business-validators ../genesis-8-10-5

# Final integration worktree
git worktree add -b feature/story-8-10-6-integration ../genesis-8-10-6
```

Each developer works in their own worktree on non-conflicting modules. When ready:
1. Push feature branch
2. Create PR to main
3. After review, merge to main
4. Other developers pull main and rebase their branches
