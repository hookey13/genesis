2. Intraday volume prediction model
3. Dynamic participation rate adjustment
4. Real-time VWAP tracking vs benchmark
5. Aggressive/passive mode selection
6. Dark pool simulation (iceberg orders)
7. Multi-venue execution ready (future)
8. Transaction cost analysis

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 5.5 (Emergency Risk Controls):
- Successfully implemented comprehensive emergency controller serving as central coordinator
- All financial calculations use Decimal for precision (never float)
- datetime.now(timezone.utc) used consistently for timestamps (no deprecated utcnow)
- EventBus integration with priority levels (CRITICAL for emergencies, HIGH for trading)
- Proper async patterns throughout using asyncio
- Configuration integration via YAML files for all thresholds and parameters
- Comprehensive test coverage required for critical paths (100% for money paths)
- Performance requirement met: detection and response <5 seconds
- Import note: EventBus from genesis.engine.event_bus (not genesis.core.events)

### Data Models
**Order Model (for VWAP executions):**
- `slice_number: Integer` - Which slice (1 of N) for VWAP orders
- `total_slices: Integer` - Total slices for this execution
- `latency_ms: Integer` - Execution latency measurement
- `slippage_percent: Decimal` - Difference from expected VWAP price
- `executed_at: DateTime` - Actual execution timestamp
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#order]

**MarketState Model (for volume tracking):**
- `volume_24h: Decimal` - 24-hour volume for pattern analysis
- `liquidity_score: Decimal` - Depth-based liquidity metric
- `spread_basis_points: Integer` - Current spread in bps
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#marketstate]

### Component Architecture
**Order Executor Component:**
- Location: `genesis/engine/executor/`
- Existing interfaces in base.py:
  - `execute_market_order(order: Order) -> ExecutionResult` - Simple market execution
  - `execute_iceberg_order(order: Order, slices: int) -> ExecutionResult` - Sliced execution
  - `execute_twap(order: Order, duration: int) -> ExecutionResult` - Time-weighted execution
- New file to create: `vwap.py` for VWAP execution algorithm
- Dependencies: Exchange Gateway, Risk Engine, Tier State Machine
- Technology: Python asyncio, ccxt for exchange interaction
[Source: architecture/components.md#order-executor, architecture/source-tree.md#execution-algorithm-location]

### External APIs

- `/ws/<symbol>@kline_1m` - 1-minute candlestick updates with volume data
[Source: architecture/external-apis.md#binance-websocket-streams-api]

**Binance Spot Trading API (for order execution):**
- `POST /api/v3/order` - Place new order with specific parameters

### File Locations
Based on project structure, create these files:
- `genesis/engine/executor/vwap.py` - Main VWAP executor implementation
- `genesis/analytics/volume_analyzer.py` - Historical volume pattern analysis
- `genesis/analytics/vwap_tracker.py` - Real-time VWAP calculation and tracking
- `tests/unit/test_vwap_executor.py` - Unit tests for VWAP executor
- `tests/unit/test_volume_analyzer.py` - Unit tests for volume analysis
- `tests/integration/test_vwap_workflow.py` - Integration tests for full VWAP workflow
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

### Technical Requirements
**Technology Stack:**
- Python 3.11.8 with CPython runtime
- asyncio for concurrent operations
- ccxt 4.2.25 for Binance API with rate limits and automatic retry
- aiohttp 3.9.3 for async HTTP with connection pooling
- websockets 12.0 for real-time market data streams
- decimal module for all financial calculations (NEVER use float)
- pandas 2.2.0 and numpy 1.26.3 for volume analysis and calculations
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table-phased-approach]

**Tier Restrictions:**
- VWAP execution is a Strategist+ tier feature (requires $10k+ trading tier)
- Must use `@requires_tier(TradingTier.STRATEGIST)` decorator on all VWAP methods
- Tier validation must occur before any VWAP execution begins
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md - vwap.py location under strategist features]

**Critical Implementation Rules:**
- NEVER use float for money - always use Decimal from decimal module
- ALWAYS use idempotency keys - every order must have a unique client_order_id
- ALWAYS validate state after restart - never assume in-memory state matches reality
- ALWAYS use database transactions for multi-step operations
- Use asyncio for all I/O - blocking I/O freezes the event loop
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]

### Configuration Integration
Configuration should be added to:
- `config/trading_rules.yaml` - Add VWAP configuration section with:
  - `vwap_participation_rate_percent` - Default participation rate (e.g., 10%)
  - `vwap_min_slice_size_usd` - Minimum slice size in USD
  - `vwap_max_slices` - Maximum number of slices
  - `vwap_time_window_minutes` - Time window for execution
  - `vwap_aggressive_threshold_percent` - Threshold for aggressive mode

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-27

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The VWAP Execution Algorithm implementation demonstrates **institutional-quality** features with comprehensive functionality covering all acceptance criteria. The implementation follows best practices with proper use of Decimal for financial calculations, tier restriction enforcement, and comprehensive test coverage. One critical import issue was identified and fixed during the review.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: genesis/analytics/vwap_tracker.py
  - **Change**: Fixed import of `Priority` to `EventPriority` from genesis.core.events
  - **Why**: Import error preventing code execution
  - **How**: Ensures proper EventBus integration with correct event priority levels

- **File**: genesis/engine/executor/vwap.py  
  - **Change**: Fixed import of `Priority` to `EventPriority` and corrected Event constructor parameters
  - **Why**: Import and constructor errors preventing proper event emission
  - **How**: Enables proper metric tracking and event handling

- **File**: tests/unit/test_vwap_tracker.py & tests/integration/test_vwap_workflow.py
  - **Change**: Fixed imports and Event constructor usage in test files
  - **Why**: Tests were failing due to incorrect imports
  - **How**: Ensures tests can properly validate the implementation

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Consistent use of Decimal, proper async patterns, UTC timestamps
- Project Structure: ✓ Proper file organization in analytics, engine, and test directories  
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit and integration tests with 85+ test methods
