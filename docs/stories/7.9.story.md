- Operational code: genesis/operations/*.py (extending existing module)
- Templates: docs/templates/*.md
- Test files: tests/unit/test_*.py and tests/integration/test_*.py

### Technical Constraints
- Must integrate with existing operations module components
- Should leverage existing DR runbook structure
- Must follow structured logging standards with JSON format
- ChatOps commands must be audited via existing audit trail system
- All money-related operations require 100% test coverage

## Testing

### Test File Locations

- Integration tests: tests/integration/test_post_mortem.py, test_incident_flow.py

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- Framework: pytest 8.0.0 with pytest-asyncio for async operations
- Coverage requirements: 100% for money paths, 90% for risk/tilt
- Test organization: tests/unit/ for isolated tests, tests/integration/ for workflows
- Use pytest-mock for mocking, faker for test data
- Fixtures in tests/conftest.py

### Testing Patterns
- Mock external dependencies (PagerDuty API, Slack webhooks)
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Verify audit trail entries for all operations
- Test incident escalation flows
- Validate runbook procedure accuracy
- Test emergency contact encryption and retrieval

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-30

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates excellent operational readiness with comprehensive runbook documentation, automated incident management, and production support tooling. The system provides thorough coverage of the top 20 failure scenarios with clear recovery procedures and automation scripts. ChatOps integration enables rapid operational response, while the encrypted contact management system ensures secure emergency communications.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: genesis/operations/incident_manager.py
  - **Change**: Fixed Event constructor calls to use correct parameter names
  - **Why**: Tests were failing due to incorrect Event API usage
  - **How**: Changed from `type` and `data` to `event_type` and `event_data` parameters

- **File**: genesis/operations/chatops.py
  - **Change**: Fixed Event constructor calls in audit methods
  - **Why**: Consistency with Event class API
  - **How**: Updated both _audit_command and _audit_unauthorized methods to use correct parameters

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Well-structured code following project conventions
- Project Structure: ✓ Properly organized in genesis/operations module
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Unit and integration tests provided with good coverage
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 8 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed Event API usage in incident_manager.py
- [x] Fixed Event API usage in chatops.py
- [x] Verified all tests pass after refactoring
- [ ] Consider adding rate limiting for ChatOps commands to prevent abuse
- [ ] Add metrics collection for incident MTTR tracking
- [ ] Consider implementing automatic runbook suggestions based on alert type

### Security Review

**Strengths:**
- Contact information properly encrypted using Fernet encryption
- ChatOps commands have authorization levels (READ, WRITE, ADMIN, EMERGENCY)
- Audit trail for all operational commands
- Secure storage of sensitive contact data

**Considerations:**
- Ensure encryption keys are properly managed in production (not hardcoded)
- Consider implementing command rate limiting to prevent ChatOps abuse
- PagerDuty credentials should be stored securely (environment variables)

### Performance Considerations

The implementation is well-optimized for operational scenarios:
- Alert deduplication prevents duplicate incident creation
- Correlation window reduces alert noise
- Efficient contact lookup and rotation calculations
- Async operations for external integrations

### Files Modified During Review

- genesis/operations/incident_manager.py - Fixed Event API usage
- genesis/operations/chatops.py - Fixed Event API usage
- genesis/operations/contact_manager.py - Added missing @dataclass decorator and fixed JSON serialization for Enums and datetime objects

- Integration test files present for complete workflows
- Coverage includes incident lifecycle, ChatOps commands, contact management
- Post-mortem generation properly tested

### Operational Excellence Assessment

**Strengths:**
1. **Comprehensive Runbooks**: 20 failure scenarios with clear recovery steps
2. **Automated Incident Management**: Alert correlation, deduplication, and escalation
3. **ChatOps Integration**: 15+ operational commands for rapid response
4. **Encrypted Contact Management**: Secure storage with rotation scheduling
5. **Post-Mortem Automation**: Timeline reconstruction and 5-whys analysis
