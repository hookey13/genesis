## Dev Notes

### Validation Framework Architecture
The validation system should follow a plugin architecture where each validator:
1. Implements a common `BaseValidator` interface
2. Returns a `ValidationResult` with pass/fail status and details
3. Can run independently or as part of the full suite
4. Supports both quick and thorough validation modes
