# Story 9.4: Comprehensive Load Testing & Performance Validation

## Story Information
**Epic:** 9 - Critical Security & Infrastructure Hardening  
**Story ID:** 9.4  
**Priority:** High (P1)  
**Estimated Effort:** 8 hours  
**Dependencies:** Stories 9.1, 9.2, 9.3 (Complete infrastructure stack)  
**Sub-Stories:** 9.4.1, 9.4.2, 9.4.3  

## User Story
As a performance engineer,  
I want comprehensive load testing that validates system behavior under extreme conditions,  
So that we know exact breaking points and can handle 100x normal load.

## Problem Statement
The current system has never been properly load tested and has no performance validation framework. Without understanding system limits, breaking points, and performance characteristics under stress, deploying to production with $100k+ capital would be extremely risky. We need to validate that the system can handle extreme trading loads, identify bottlenecks, detect memory leaks, and ensure graceful degradation under failure conditions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Load testing with Locust simulating 1000+ concurrent users
2. Order processing throughput >1000 orders/second
3. WebSocket connection stability with 10,000 connections
4. Database query performance <5ms p99 under load
5. Memory leak detection over 48-hour runs
6. CPU profiling identifying hot paths
7. Network latency simulation (100ms-500ms)
8. Chaos testing with random failures
9. Graceful degradation validation
10. Performance regression detection in CI/CD

## Load Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Normal Trading Day
```python
class NormalTradingUser(HttpUser):
    weight = 70
    wait_time = between(5, 30)  # 5-30 second pauses between actions
    
    @task(5)
    def check_positions(self):
        # Check positions every ~2 minutes
        
    @task(2)
    def place_order(self):
        # Place order every ~5 minutes
        
    @task(3)
    def check_market_data(self):
        # Check market data frequently
```

### Scenario 2: High-Frequency Trading
```python
class HighFrequencyTrader(HttpUser):
    weight = 20
    wait_time = between(0.1, 1.0)  # Very aggressive trading
    
    @task(10)
    def place_order(self):
        # Very frequent order placement
        
    @task(5)
    def cancel_order(self):
        # Frequent order cancellation
```

### Scenario 3: Market Data Consumers
```python
class MarketDataUser(HttpUser):
    weight = 10
    wait_time = between(1, 5)  # Frequent market data requests
    
    @task(20)
    def get_market_data(self):
        # Continuous market data consumption
```

## Performance Regression Testing

### CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# .github/workflows/performance-test.yml
name: Performance Regression Test
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
    
jobs:
  performance-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run Performance Test
        run: |
          docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d
          pytest tests/performance/regression_test.py
          
      - name: Compare Results
        run: |
          python scripts/compare_performance.py \
            --baseline performance/baseline.json \
            --current performance/current.json \
            --threshold 0.1  # 10% regression threshold
```

## Notes
This is a **CRITICAL VALIDATION** story that ensures the system can handle production trading loads. Without proper load testing, deploying the system with real capital would be extremely risky.

The testing must be comprehensive and cover:
- **Functional load testing** - ensuring features work under stress
- **Performance testing** - measuring response times and throughput
- **Stability testing** - ensuring no memory leaks or resource exhaustion
- **Chaos testing** - validating failure recovery mechanisms

Load testing will reveal:
- System bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- Breaking points and capacity limits
- Memory leaks and resource management issues
- Database query performance under concurrent load
- WebSocket connection scalability limits
- Network and I/O performance characteristics

The results will inform capacity planning, scaling decisions, and performance optimization priorities. This testing is essential before any production deployment with real trading capital.
