## Dev Notes

### Existing Monitoring Infrastructure
The project already has a comprehensive monitoring setup in `genesis/monitoring/`:

**Key Files to Modify:**
- `genesis/monitoring/prometheus_exporter.py` - Existing Prometheus exporter with FastAPI endpoint
- `genesis/monitoring/metrics_collector.py` - Trading metrics collection (TradingMetrics dataclass)
- `genesis/api/metrics_endpoints.py` - REST API metrics endpoints
- `genesis/monitoring/performance_monitor.py` - Performance monitoring utilities

**Existing Metric Classes:**
```python
# From metrics_collector.py
@dataclass
class TradingMetrics:
    orders_placed: int
    orders_filled: int
    orders_cancelled: int
    orders_failed: int
    total_volume: Decimal
    realized_pnl: Decimal
    unrealized_pnl: Decimal
    # ... etc
```

**Current Prometheus Implementation:**
- Uses prometheus_client library
- MetricsRegistry class at `prometheus_exporter.py`
- FastAPI endpoint already configured with authentication
- Rate limiting via slowapi

### Metric Naming Conventions
Follow Prometheus best practices:
- Prefix: `genesis_`
- Unit suffixes: `_total`, `_seconds`, `_bytes`
- Label names: lowercase with underscores

Examples:
```python
genesis_orders_total{exchange="binance", symbol="BTC/USDT", status="filled"}
genesis_order_latency_seconds{exchange="binance", type="market"}
genesis_trading_pnl_usdt{strategy="arbitrage", symbol="ETH/USDT"}
```

### Integration Points

**Enhance MetricsCollector class:**
```python
# genesis/monitoring/metrics_collector.py
class MetricsCollector:
    def __init__(self, registry: MetricsRegistry):
        # Define Prometheus metrics
        self.order_counter = Counter(
            'genesis_orders_total',
            'Total orders by status',
            ['exchange', 'symbol', 'side', 'status']
        )
        self.order_latency = Histogram(
            'genesis_order_latency_seconds',
            'Order execution latency',
            ['exchange', 'order_type'],
            buckets=[.001, .005, .01, .025, .05, .1, .25, .5, 1.0]
        )
```

**Prometheus Endpoint Configuration:**
- Endpoint: `GET /metrics`
- Authentication: Bearer token from environment variable
- Format: Prometheus text format (text/plain; version=0.0.4)

### Grafana Dashboard Structure
Create JSON dashboard configs in `genesis/config/grafana/`:
```
genesis/config/grafana/
├── trading_operations.json
├── system_performance.json
└── alerts.json
```

Dashboard panels should include:
- Order flow rate graph
- P&L over time
- Position distribution pie chart
- System resource gauges
- WebSocket connection status
- API rate limit usage

### Performance Considerations
- Use lazy metric updates (batch where possible)
- Implement metric caching with TTL
- Avoid high-cardinality labels (no unique IDs)
- Use histograms instead of storing all values

### Environment Variables
```bash
PROMETHEUS_ENABLED=true
PROMETHEUS_PORT=9090
METRICS_AUTH_TOKEN=<secure-token>
GRAFANA_URL=http://localhost:3000
METRICS_RETENTION_DAYS=30
```
