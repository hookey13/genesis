### Logging Standards and Requirements
[Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#logging-standards]

**Log Format Requirements:**
- JSON with mandatory fields: timestamp, level, component, error_type, context
- Correlation ID (UUID) per operation chain
- Service context: component, function, line number
- User context: NO PII, only account_id and tier
- NEVER use print() - always use structlog

**Log Levels:**
- DEBUG: Development only
- INFO: Normal operation
- WARNING: Degraded performance
- ERROR: Component failure
- CRITICAL: Money at risk

### Metrics Collection Specifications
[Source: architecture/components.md#analytics-engine]

**Key Metrics Interfaces:**
- `calculate_performance_metrics() -> PerformanceReport`: Win rate, Sharpe ratio, etc.
- `generate_session_report(session_id: UUID) -> SessionReport`: Trading session analysis
- `analyze_tilt_correlation() -> TiltImpact`: Behavioral analysis

**Required Metrics:**
- Order execution times (<100ms target)
- Position counts and P&L
- Win rate and Sharpe ratio
- System uptime (99.5% minimum)
- Connection status and latency
- Rate limit utilization
- Tilt scores and correlations

### Alert Configuration Requirements
[Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#external-api-errors]

**Circuit Breaker Settings:**
- Open after 5 failures in 30 seconds
- Half-open after 60 seconds
- Full reset after successful operation

**Retry Policy:**
- Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, max 30s
- Maximum 5 retry attempts
- Timeout: Connect 5s, Read 10s, Total 30s

**Critical Alert Conditions:**
- Daily loss exceeds 15% (emergency demotion)
- Tilt score exceeds thresholds
- Position limit violations
- Correlation limit breaches
- Connection loss >60 seconds
- Rate limit 80% utilization

### Performance Profiling Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Profiling Tools:**
- pandas 2.2.0 for statistical calculations
- numpy 1.26.3 for array operations and correlation matrices
- pytest-cov 4.1.0 for code coverage reporting

**Performance Targets:**
- <100ms execution path for critical operations
- 99.5% uptime requirement
- 90% execution speed for tier progression gates
- <1% overhead from monitoring/profiling

### Integration Points
[Source: architecture/components.md#event-bus]

**Event Bus Integration:**
- Subscribe to all events for metrics collection
- Use NORMAL priority lane (not HIGH like execution)
- Implement `get_event_history()` for replay/forensics
- Maintain event correlation for distributed tracing

**Repository Layer Integration:**
- Abstract data access for future PostgreSQL migration
- Query patterns for metrics aggregation
- Audit trail queries for compliance reporting

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-29

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The monitoring platform implementation demonstrates solid architectural design with comprehensive feature coverage across all 8 acceptance criteria. The codebase shows strong async patterns, proper type hints, and structured logging throughout. However, the implementation contains critical security vulnerabilities, lacks production readiness, and has significant test coverage gaps. The heavy reliance on mock data instead of real system integration severely impacts the actual monitoring capabilities.

### Risk Assessment: HIGH

**Auto-escalated to deep review due to:**
- Security-critical files touched (authentication, alerting, data exposure)
- Minimal test coverage (only 2 of 7 components have tests)
- Large diff size (>3000 lines of new code)
- Production infrastructure components

### Requirements Traceability

**Acceptance Criteria Coverage:**

| AC | Requirement | Implementation | Test Coverage | Status |
|----|-------------|----------------|---------------|--------|
| 1 | Prometheus metrics collection | ✅ prometheus_exporter.py, metrics_collector.py | ⚠️ Partial (unit tests exist) | CONCERNS |
| 2 | Grafana dashboards P&L/latency/errors | ✅ Dashboard JSON files created | ❌ No tests | CONCERNS |
| 3 | ELK stack log aggregation | ✅ logstash.conf configured | ❌ No tests | CONCERNS |
| 4 | Distributed tracing Jaeger/OpenTelemetry | ✅ trace_context.py implemented | ❌ No tests | FAIL |
| 5 | Custom alerts drawdown/tilt/disconnect | ✅ alert_manager.py with rules | ❌ No tests | FAIL |
| 6 | SLA tracking 99.9% uptime | ⚠️ sla_tracker.py with mock data | ❌ No tests | FAIL |
| 7 | Performance profiling flame graphs | ✅ performance_profiler.py | ❌ No tests | CONCERNS |
| 8 | Capacity planning forecasting | ⚠️ capacity_planner.py with mock ML | ❌ No tests | CONCERNS |

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring performed during this review due to the scope and criticality of issues found. The code requires security hardening and test coverage before any optimization refactoring.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✗ Missing error boundaries, inconsistent exception handling
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows architecture/source-tree.md layout
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Only 28% component test coverage (2/7 files)
- All ACs Met: ✗ Mock data implementation, missing production integration

### Critical Security Issues

**HIGH SEVERITY:**
1. **Weak Authentication** - Basic bearer token without rotation (prometheus_exporter.py:144-149)
2. **Information Disclosure** - Metrics endpoint exposes sensitive trading data without encryption
3. **Injection Vulnerabilities** - No input sanitization for metric labels/names
4. **Missing Rate Limiting** - DoS vulnerability on /metrics endpoint

**MEDIUM SEVERITY:**
5. **Sensitive Data in Logs** - No PII/secret sanitization in structured logs
6. **Unrestricted Resource Access** - psutil usage without bounds checking
7. **Missing HTTPS** - Metrics transmitted in plaintext

### Performance Considerations

**CONCERNS:**
- 10-second collection interval creates unnecessary overhead
- Function decoration adds latency to every monitored call
- 90-day in-memory history storage risks OOM conditions
- No circuit breaker pattern for external notification services
- Missing connection pooling for HTTP clients

### Test Coverage Analysis

**Critical Gaps:**
- 71% of monitoring components lack ANY unit tests
- No integration tests for component interactions
- Missing failure scenario testing (network, OOM, API limits)
- No performance benchmarking or load testing
- No security/penetration testing

**Test Files Status:**
- ✅ test_prometheus_exporter.py (exists)
- ✅ test_metrics_collector.py (exists)  
- ❌ test_alert_manager.py (missing)
- ❌ test_trace_context.py (missing)
- ❌ test_sla_tracker.py (missing)
- ❌ test_performance_profiler.py (missing)
- ❌ test_capacity_planner.py (missing)

### Files Modified During Review

No files were modified during this review.

### Gate Status

Gate: **FAIL** → docs/qa/gates/7.4-monitoring-observability-platform.yml
Risk profile: Created comprehensive risk assessment
NFR assessment: Multiple NFR violations identified

### NFR Validation Summary

| Category | Status | Critical Issues |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| Security | FAIL | Weak auth, info disclosure, no encryption |
| Performance | CONCERNS | High overhead, no optimization, memory risks |
| Reliability | FAIL | No failover, missing health checks, mock data |
| Maintainability | CONCERNS | Poor test coverage, missing documentation |

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required - Critical issues must be addressed**

The story cannot proceed to Done status due to:
1. Critical security vulnerabilities that expose trading data
2. 71% of components lacking any test coverage
3. Mock data implementation instead of real monitoring
4. Production-blocking reliability issues

**Priority Actions Required:**
1. IMMEDIATE: Fix authentication and add HTTPS (2-4 hours)
2. HIGH: Add missing unit tests (8-12 hours)
3. HIGH: Replace mock implementations (6-8 hours)
4. MEDIUM: Add integration tests and documentation (4-6 hours)

Total estimated effort: 20-30 hours of additional work required.
