- **Lint Jobs**: Black formatter, Ruff linter, MyPy type checker
- **Security Jobs**: Safety check, Bandit scan, detect-secrets
- **Test Execution**: Parallel matrix for unit and integration tests
- **Coverage Generation**: XML and term-missing reports
- **Quality Gates**: All jobs must pass before deployment

### Project Structure
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md, architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **Test Directory**:
  ```
  tests/
  ├── __init__.py
  ├── conftest.py        # Pytest fixtures
  ├── unit/              # Unit test files
  ├── integration/       # Integration test files
  └── fixtures/          # Test data files
  ```

### Code Quality Tools
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Black 24.1.1**: Code formatter (line length 88)
- **Ruff 0.1.14**: Fast Python linter

- **All functions require type hints**

### Makefile Targets to Verify
[Source: Makefile in project root]
Common targets that should work:
- `make test`: Run all tests
- `make lint`: Run linting checks
- `make format`: Format code with Black
- `make coverage`: Generate coverage report
- `make migrate`: Run database migrations

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **NEVER use float for money** - use Decimal
- **ALWAYS use database transactions** for multi-step operations
- **ALWAYS validate state after restart**
- **100% coverage required** for money-handling code

  - 90% for risk/tilt detection
  - 70% for UI/analytics
- **Test Pyramid**: 70% unit, 20% integration, 10% end-to-end
- **Test Data**: Fixtures in `tests/fixtures/` directory
- **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup after each test
- **Builder Pattern**: For test object creation

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-28

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Excellent infrastructure recovery** - All critical infrastructure components have been successfully restored and are operational. The development team has methodically addressed each infrastructure failure point:

- **Database Migrations**: Complete chain from 001-010 properly sequenced with SQLite compatibility fixes
- **Test Framework**: 1922 tests collected successfully, though 23 have import errors (1.2% failure rate)
- **Coverage System**: Operational at 20.39% baseline, exceeding 0% requirement
- **Build Automation**: All critical Makefile targets functional
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow configured

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring required - this was an infrastructure repair story focused on restoration rather than code improvement.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Black/Ruff/MyPy properly configured in pyproject.toml
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows unified structure with proper test organization
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Pytest configured with markers, coverage thresholds, async support
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 5 acceptance criteria verified and functional

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Alembic migrations fixed and operational (verified 010 at head)
- [x] Test collection working (1922 tests discovered)
- [x] Coverage reporting functional (20.39% baseline established)
- [x] CI/CD pipeline configured (comprehensive quality gates)
- [x] Makefile commands verified (all critical targets working)
- [ ] Update outdated dependencies (aiohttp 3.8.4→3.12.15, others for security)
- [ ] Fix remaining 23 test import errors (non-blocking technical debt)
- [ ] Consider adding pre-commit hooks for automated formatting

### Security Review

**CONCERNS**: Several dependencies are significantly outdated:
- aiohttp: 3.8.4 (current: 3.12.15) - potential security vulnerabilities
- websockets: 12.0 (current: 15.0.1) - missing security patches
- Other outdated: ccxt, numpy, pandas

**Recommendation**: Schedule dependency updates in next maintenance cycle.

### Performance Considerations

- Test collection time: 7.89s for 1922 tests - acceptable
- Database size: 602KB - healthy for development
- Migration execution: Fast with proper indexing
- Coverage calculation: Efficient with 27,080 lines analyzed

### Files Modified During Review

None - Infrastructure validation only, no code changes required.

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/0.1-fix-infrastructure-testing.yml
- Minor security concerns with outdated dependencies
- 23 test import errors remain as technical debt

### Recommended Status

✓ Ready for Done - All acceptance criteria met, infrastructure operational. Address dependency updates and test errors in future stories.
