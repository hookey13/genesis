# Story 10.2: Sniper Tier Trading Strategy Implementation

**Epic:** Epic 10 - Core Trading Brain Implementation
**Type:** Parallel-Safe (Can be split)
**Branch:** feature/10-2
**Estimated Hours:** 12
**Developer Assignment:** Strategy Team Lead

## User Story
As a strategy developer,
I want to implement the complete Sniper tier trading strategy with simple arbitrage and momentum detection,
So that the system can execute profitable trades in the $500-$2k capital range with appropriate risk management.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Simple arbitrage strategy for spread capture
2. Momentum breakout detection on single pairs
3. Position sizing using Kelly criterion (capped at 2% risk)
4. Entry signal generation with confidence scoring
5. Exit signal generation (take profit and stop loss)
6. Strategy state persistence and recovery
7. Performance tracking per strategy instance
8. Integration with existing risk engine
9. Backtesting validation showing positive expectancy
10. Paper trading mode for strategy validation

## Technical Implementation
