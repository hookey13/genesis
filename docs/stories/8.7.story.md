## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 8.6 (Containerization & Orchestration):
- Health check endpoints implemented using `genesis/cli/doctor.py`
- Prometheus metrics exposed on port 9090
- Docker and Kubernetes configurations complete with resource limits
- Multi-platform container builds with security scanning

### Architecture Context

#### Tech Stack
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Python Version**: 3.11.8 (CPython)
- **Async Framework**: asyncio (stdlib)
- **HTTP Client**: aiohttp 3.9.3 for async HTTP with connection pooling
- **Exchange Library**: ccxt 4.2.25 with built-in rate limit handling
- **Cache/Queue**: Python dicts + asyncio.Queue for MVP, Redis 7.2.4 at $2k+
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus 2.48.1 at $5k+ for metrics collection
- **Logging**: structlog 24.1.0 for structured JSON logging

#### External API Integration
[Source: architecture/external-apis.md#binance-spot-trading-api]
- **Binance Rate Limits**:
  - 1200 requests per minute (weight-based)
  - 50 orders per 10 seconds
  - 160,000 orders per day
- **Integration Notes**:
  - Use ccxt library's built-in rate limit handling as base
  - Implement circuit breaker with exponential backoff (2^n seconds, max 60s)
  - Track weight consumption, stay below 80% capacity
  - Use `recvWindow` of 5000ms for time synchronization tolerance

#### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture/components.md#exchange-gateway]
- **Exchange Gateway** already exists with these interfaces:
  - `place_order(order: Order) -> ExchangeOrder`
  - `cancel_order(order_id: str) -> None`
  - `get_balance() -> Balance`
  - `subscribe_market_data(symbol: str) -> AsyncIterator[Tick]`
- Technology Stack: ccxt, websockets, aiohttp with circuit breaker pattern

#### Error Handling Strategy
[Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#external-api-errors]
- **Retry Policy**: Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, max 30s
- **Circuit Breaker**: Open after 5 failures in 30 seconds, half-open after 60s
- **Timeout Configuration**: Connect: 5s, Read: 10s, Total: 30s
- **Error Translation**: Map Binance errors to domain exceptions

#### File Locations
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Rate limiter should go in: `genesis/core/rate_limiter.py`
- Circuit breaker already noted at: `genesis/exchange/circuit_breaker.py`
- Exchange gateway at: `genesis/exchange/gateway.py`
- Tests follow pattern: `tests/unit/test_{module}.py` and `tests/integration/test_{workflow}.py`

#### Existing Error Handling
From Story 8.3 implementation details in Epic:
- Global error handler with categorized error types
- Retry decorator with exponential backoff already defined
- Circuit breaker pattern partially shown in error handling
- Correlation ID tracking across components

### Testing
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Framework**: pytest 8.0.0 with pytest-asyncio
- **Unit Tests**: Located in `tests/unit/`, mirror source structure
- **Integration Tests**: Located in `tests/integration/`
- **Coverage Requirements**: 100% for risk_engine, executor, math utils
- **Test Organization**: `test_{module}.py` naming convention
- **Mocking**: pytest-mock with faker for test data

### Critical Implementation Notes
- NEVER use float for money calculations - use Decimal
- ALWAYS use asyncio for all I/O operations
- Circuit breaker states must persist across restarts
- Rate limits must account for weight-based consumption
- Priority operations (emergency close) must bypass normal queues
- Redis integration is optional at MVP, required at $2k+

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-31

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates strong technical competence with comprehensive rate limiting and circuit breaker patterns. The code properly uses Decimal for calculations, implements multiple degradation strategies, and provides good separation of concerns. However, integration testing revealed method signature mismatches between the rate limiter and gateway that would have caused runtime errors.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: genesis/exchange/gateway.py
  - **Change**: Replaced all calls to non-existent `check_and_wait` method with proper `_make_request_with_priority` calls
  - **Why**: The gateway was calling a method that doesn't exist on the rate limiter
  - **How**: This ensures proper rate limiting is applied with correct weight and priority for each endpoint

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows async patterns, uses Decimal for money, proper error handling
- Project Structure: ✓ Components properly organized in core/ and exchange/ modules
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Unit and integration tests present with good coverage
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 10 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed method signature mismatches in gateway integration (genesis/exchange/gateway.py)
- [x] Applied consistent priority handling across all exchange endpoints
- [ ] Add runtime integration tests to catch method signature issues earlier
- [ ] Implement Prometheus metrics integration for alerting (partially done)
- [ ] Add Grafana dashboard for circuit breaker visualization

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. Rate limiting properly protects against DoS attacks. Circuit breaker prevents cascading failures. No credentials or secrets exposed in code. Priority system ensures critical operations (emergency close) can bypass normal limits appropriately.

### Performance Considerations

Excellent performance characteristics:
- Token bucket algorithm provides efficient O(1) rate checking
- Sliding window properly manages burst protection
- Request coalescing reduces duplicate API calls
- Adaptive rate limiting responds to actual API usage
- Circuit breaker cache strategy reduces load during failures

### Files Modified During Review

- genesis/exchange/gateway.py (fixed 6 method calls to use correct rate limiter interface)

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/8.7-rate-limiting-circuit-breakers.yml

### Recommended Status

✗ Changes Required - Integration issues fixed but need runtime tests to prevent regression
