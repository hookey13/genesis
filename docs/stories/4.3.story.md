## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 4.2 (Multi-Pair Trading):
- MultiPairManager successfully implemented portfolio-level risk controls
- Correlation monitoring system established with 60% warning, 80% critical thresholds
- Signal queue with priority system is operational for competing signals
- Performance attribution tracking by pair is functional
- Database migration pattern established with proper indexing

### Technology Stack
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Python 3.11.8 exclusively (no Python 3.12 features allowed)
- Decimal module for ALL monetary calculations (NEVER use float)
- asyncio for all I/O operations
- ccxt 4.2.25 for exchange interaction
- pandas 2.2.0 and numpy 1.26.3 for calculations
- structlog 24.1.0 for structured logging

### Data Models
**Order Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- order_id: UUID - Unique order identifier
- symbol: String - Trading pair (e.g., "BTC/USDT")
- side: Enum[BUY|SELL] - Order direction
- order_type: Enum[MARKET|LIMIT|STOP_LOSS|TAKE_PROFIT] - Order type
- quantity: Decimal - Order size in base currency
- price: Decimal - Limit price (null for market orders)
- status: Enum[PENDING|PARTIAL|FILLED|CANCELLED|FAILED] - Current status
- slice_number: Integer - Which time slice (for TWAP)
- total_slices: Integer - Total time intervals
- slippage_percent: Decimal - Actual vs expected price difference
- created_at: Timestamp - Order creation time
- executed_at: Timestamp - Execution time

**ExecutionResult Model** [Source: architecture/base.py lines 76-85]
- success: bool - Whether execution succeeded
- executed_quantity: Decimal - Amount actually executed
- average_price: Decimal - Volume-weighted average execution price
- slippage_percent: Decimal - Price slippage
- execution_time_ms: int - Total execution duration
- error_message: Optional[str] - Error details if failed

### Database Schema
**Events Table for TWAP tracking** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md lines 21-30]
```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
    event_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    event_type TEXT NOT NULL,  -- "TwapSliceExecuted", "TwapCompleted"
    aggregate_id TEXT NOT NULL,  -- TWAP execution ID
    event_data TEXT NOT NULL,    -- JSON with slice details
    sequence_number INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Orders Table supports TWAP** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md lines 86-87]
- slice_number and total_slices columns already exist
- status tracking for partial fills
- slippage_percent for performance measurement

### Existing Executor Patterns
**Base OrderExecutor Class** [Source: architecture/base.py]
All executors must inherit from OrderExecutor and implement:
- `validate_order(order: Order) -> ValidationResult` - Comprehensive order validation
- `generate_client_order_id() -> str` - For idempotency
- `calculate_slippage(expected: Decimal, actual: Decimal) -> Decimal`
- `execute() -> ExecutionResult` - Main execution method

**IcebergExecutor Pattern** [Source: Story 4.1 implementation]
- Uses `@requires_tier(TradingTier.HUNTER)` decorator for tier gating
- Implements random time delays between slices (1-5 seconds)
- Slice size variation (Â±20%) to avoid detection
- Monitors market impact per slice
- Aborts if slippage exceeds threshold

**ExecutionStrategy Enum** [Source: architecture/base.py line 92]
- TWAP already defined in enum, no modification needed

### Component Specifications
**Risk Engine Integration** [Source: architecture/components.md]
- Must call `check_risk_limits(position: Position) -> RiskDecision` before each slice
- Use `calculate_position_size(balance: Decimal, risk_percent: Decimal)` for sizing
- Tier verification required before execution

**Market Data Service** [Source: architecture/market_data_service.py]
- `get_current_price(symbol: str) -> Decimal` - Real-time price
- `get_24h_ticker(symbol: str)` - Returns 24h volume data
- `VolumeProfile` class - Hourly volume patterns (lines 118-146)
- `is_volume_anomaly() -> bool` - Detect unusual volume
- `get_order_book(symbol: str, depth: int) -> OrderBook` - Market depth

**Event Bus** [Source: architecture/components.md]
- Publish with Priority.HIGH for execution events
- Publish with Priority.NORMAL for progress updates
- Event types: EventType.ORDER_EXECUTED, EventType.EXECUTION_FAILED

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- TWAP executor: `genesis/engine/executor/twap.py` (note: source-tree shows vwap.py but we're implementing TWAP)
- TWAP analyzer: `genesis/analytics/twap_analyzer.py`
- UI widget: `genesis/ui/widgets/twap_progress.py`
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_twap_executor.py`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_twap_workflow.py`
- Database migration: `alembic/versions/008_add_twap_execution_tables.py`

### Technical Constraints
**Coding Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Classes: PascalCase (e.g., `TwapExecutor`)
- Functions: snake_case (e.g., `calculate_time_slices`)
- Money variables: Suffix with currency (e.g., `slice_value_usdt`)
- Time variables: Suffix with unit (e.g., `duration_minutes`, `interval_seconds`)
- ALWAYS use client_order_id for idempotency
- ALWAYS use database transactions for multi-step operations
- NEVER modify tier without state machine
- Decimal precision for ALL monetary values

**Tier Requirements** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- STRATEGIST Tier ($10k+): Required for TWAP execution
- Advanced execution algorithms unlocked at this tier
- Must enforce tier gate in executor initialization

### Volume and Timing Considerations
**Volume Profile Usage** [Source: architecture/market_data_service.py lines 118-146]
- Use VolumeProfile.get_hourly_volumes() for adaptive slice timing
- Respect is_high_volume_period() for participation rate adjustment
- Monitor volume anomalies that might affect execution

**Time Slice Management**
- Use datetime and timedelta for precise timing
- Implement random jitter (like Iceberg) to avoid predictable patterns
- Background task pattern using asyncio for interval-based execution
- Store state for pause/resume capability

### Risk Management Rules
**Participation Rate Limits**
- Maximum 10% of current volume per slice (AC: 3)
- Dynamically adjust based on real-time volume
- Reduce participation during low-volume periods

**Early Completion Logic** (AC: 5)
- Monitor price relative to initial benchmark
- Complete early if price moves favorably beyond threshold
- Configurable improvement threshold (e.g., 0.2% better than target)

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Framework: pytest 8.0.0 with pytest-asyncio
- Coverage requirement: 100% for executor code (money-path)
- Mock exchange responses with VCR.py
- Use Decimal for all monetary test values
- Database testing with in-memory SQLite

**Critical Test Scenarios:**
- Time window configuration (5, 15, 30 minutes)
- Adaptive slice timing based on volume patterns
- Participation rate enforcement at 10% limit
- Benchmark price tracking accuracy
- Early completion trigger on favorable prices
- Pause/resume state persistence
- Progress calculation and display
- Post-trade analysis calculations
- Network failure handling during execution
- Tier gate enforcement (reject non-Strategist)
- Slippage calculation for each slice
- Volume anomaly response

**Test File Locations:**
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_twap_executor.py`
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_twap_analyzer.py`
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_twap_progress_widget.py`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_twap_workflow.py`
- Migration tests: `tests/unit/test_migration_008.py`

**Testing Patterns:**
- Use `pytest.mark.asyncio` for async test methods
- Use `@pytest.fixture` for test data builders
- Mock MarketDataService responses for volume data
- Test edge cases: zero volume, extreme volatility
- Verify all Decimal calculations maintain precision
