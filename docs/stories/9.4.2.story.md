## Dev Notes

### Testing Framework & Standards
The Genesis project uses the following testing standards that must be adhered to:

**Test File Locations:**
- Load tests: `tests/load/` directory
- WebSocket specific tests: `tests/load/websocket_load_test.py`
- Performance benchmarks: `tests/performance/`
- Test fixtures: `tests/fixtures/`

**Testing Frameworks:**
- **Locust** (v2.17+): Primary load testing framework
- **websockets** library: WebSocket client implementation
- **pytest**: Unit and integration testing
- **pytest-asyncio**: Async test support
- **prometheus_client**: Metrics collection
- **psutil**: System resource monitoring

**Existing Infrastructure:**
The project already has a docker-compose setup for load testing in the parent story (9.4):
- Locust master/worker configuration exists
- Prometheus and Grafana are configured
- Base load testing framework in `tests/load/test_trading_loop_load.py`

```

### Technical Implementation Context

**WebSocket Endpoint:**
- Base URL: `ws://localhost:8000/ws/market`
- Authentication: Bearer token in connection params or headers
- Channels: ['ticker', 'orderbook', 'trades']
- Message format: JSON with action, channel, and data fields

**Connection Parameters:**
- Max connections per worker: 250 (to avoid file descriptor limits)
- Connection timeout: 30 seconds
- Heartbeat interval: 30 seconds
- Reconnection backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 32s (max)

**Monitoring Integration:**
From the parent story's monitoring setup:
- Prometheus endpoint: http://localhost:9090
- Grafana dashboard: http://localhost:3000
- Metrics to track: `genesis_websocket_connections`, `genesis_websocket_messages`, `genesis_websocket_latency`

**Resource Limits to Consider:**
- Default ulimit for file descriptors: 1024 (must increase for 10k connections)
- Memory per connection: ~50KB expected
- Network buffer sizes: May need tuning for high throughput

### Dependencies from Parent Story
The parent story (9.4) provides:
1. Locust distributed testing infrastructure (docker-compose.load-test.yml)
2. Performance monitoring setup (PerformanceMonitor class)
3. Memory leak detection framework (MemoryLeakDetector class)
4. Metrics collection infrastructure (Prometheus/Grafana)

These components should be reused rather than recreated.

## Testing

### Validation Steps
1. **Unit Tests:**
   - Test WebSocket connection establishment
   - Test message parsing and validation
   - Test reconnection logic
   - Test metric collection accuracy

2. **Integration Tests:**
   - Test with actual Genesis WebSocket server
   - Verify metric export to Prometheus
   - Test distributed Locust setup

3. **Load Test Execution:**
   ```bash
   # Start the load test infrastructure
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.load-test.yml up -d

   # Run WebSocket load test
   locust -f tests/load/websocket_load_test.py \
          --host ws://localhost:8000 \
          --users 10000 \
          --spawn-rate 100 \
          --run-time 48h
   ```

4. **Performance Validation:**
   - Verify <10ms p99 latency under full load
   - Confirm 99.9% message delivery rate
   - Check memory growth <2% over 48 hours
   - Validate 10,000+ concurrent connections

### Success Metrics Verification
- Connection count reaches and sustains 10,000+
- Message latency p99 < 10ms consistently
- Zero message loss under normal conditions
- Memory usage stable (< 2% growth over test duration)
- Successful recovery from all simulated failures

The development team has successfully addressed all critical concerns:

1. **Authentication Implementation:** ✅ Bearer token authentication now properly implemented with environment variable support
2. **Rate Limiting:** ✅ Comprehensive rate limiting added (100/min, 10/sec) with proper async locking
3. **Message Validation:** ✅ Full message structure validation and sanitization implemented
4. **Code Quality:** ✅ ALL linting violations resolved - ruff passes with no errors
5. **Type Safety:** ✅ ALL mypy errors resolved - proper typing throughout

### Security Improvements Implemented:
- Bearer token authentication via `GENESIS_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable
- Rate limiting with configurable thresholds (MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_MINUTE, MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_SECOND)
- Message validation for structure, required fields, and content sanitization
- Protection against overly long string injection (1000 char limit)
