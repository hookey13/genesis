### File Ownership Matrix

| Developer | Primary Files | No-Touch Zones |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| Dev 1 | `genesis/security/bcrypt_manager.py`<br>`genesis/database/connection_pool.py`<br>`tests/load/websocket_tests.py`<br>`genesis/monitoring/metrics_collector.py` | JWT files, Vault setup |
| Dev 2 | `genesis/security/jwt_manager.py`<br>`genesis/security/vault_setup.py`<br>`tests/load/memory_profiler.py`<br>`genesis/monitoring/trace_manager.py` | Bcrypt files, Database migration |
| Dev 3 | `genesis/security/totp_2fa.py`<br>`genesis/security/vault_client.py`<br>`genesis/reliability/backup_manager.py`<br>`genesis/monitoring/alert_manager.py` | JWT files, Load tests |
| Dev 4 | `genesis/database/migration_manager.py`<br>`tests/load/locust_tests.py`<br>`genesis/reliability/failover_manager.py` | Auth files, Monitoring |

### Testing Checkpoints

**Unit Test Coverage Requirements:**
- Authentication components: 100% coverage
- Database operations: 95% coverage
- Vault integration: 100% coverage
- Load testing: N/A (is test infrastructure)
- Disaster recovery: 90% coverage
- Monitoring: 85% coverage

**Integration Test Gates:**
- [ ] Auth system with all three components
- [ ] Database with connection pooling
- [ ] Vault with secret rotation
- [ ] Load test achieving 1000 TPS
- [ ] Backup and restore cycle
- [ ] Full monitoring pipeline

### Merge Strategy

1. **Feature Branch Protection:**
   - All PRs require code review
   - CI/CD must pass before merge
   - Security scan required

2. **Merge Order:**
   ```
   Day 2 EOD: 9.1.1, 9.1.2, 9.2.1
   Day 3 EOD: 9.1.3, 9.2.2, 9.3.1
   Day 4 EOD: 9.3.2, 9.4.1, 9.4.2, 9.4.3
   Day 5 AM: 9.5.1, 9.5.2
   Day 5 PM: 9.6.1, 9.6.2, 9.6.3
   ```

3. **Conflict Resolution:**
   - Main branch is source of truth
   - Conflicts resolved by story owner
   - Integration lead breaks ties

### Risk Mitigation

**Backup Plans:**
- If PostgreSQL migration fails: Continue with SQLite + optimization
- If Vault unavailable: Use encrypted env vars temporarily
- If load tests fail: Scale back performance targets
- If integration blocked: Deploy components incrementally

**Communication Escalation:**
1. Slack channel: #epic-9-security
2. Blocker escalation: Team lead within 30 minutes
3. Critical issues: CTO notification within 1 hour

### Success Criteria

**Day 1-2 Success:**
- [ ] All authentication components functional
- [ ] Database migration script tested
- [ ] Zero merge conflicts

**Day 3-4 Success:**
- [ ] Vault storing all secrets
- [ ] Load tests passing 500 TPS
- [ ] Backup system operational

**Day 5 Success:**
- [ ] Full integration complete
- [ ] All security vulnerabilities addressed
- [ ] Production deployment ready
- [ ] Documentation complete

### Post-Implementation

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Security audit passed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Disaster recovery tested
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards live
- [ ] Runbooks updated
- [ ] Team trained on new systems

**Handoff Requirements:**
- Complete documentation in Confluence

### Final Notes

This is a **CRITICAL** epic addressing severe security vulnerabilities. All developers must:
1. Prioritize security over speed
2. Follow secure coding practices
3. Never commit secrets to git
4. Test thoroughly before merging
5. Document all changes

**Remember**: We're handling $100k+ in production. One mistake could mean total loss of funds.
