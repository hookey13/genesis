```

#### File Locations and Ownership

**Files to Create:**
- `genesis/strategies/strategist/__init__.py` - Module initialization
- `genesis/strategies/strategist/vwap_execution.py` - Main VWAP strategy implementation
- `genesis/execution/volume_curve.py` - Volume curve estimation logic
- `genesis/execution/order_slicer.py` - Order slicing algorithms
- `genesis/execution/execution_scheduler.py` - Execution scheduling logic
- `tests/unit/test_vwap_execution.py` - Unit tests for VWAP strategy
- `tests/integration/test_execution_algos.py` - Integration tests

**Module Ownership:**
- **Primary Ownership:** `genesis/strategies/strategist/vwap_execution.py`
- **Secondary Ownership:** `genesis/execution/volume_curve.py`
- **Tertiary Ownership:** `genesis/execution/order_slicer.py`
- **No Touch Modules:** `market_maker.py` (owned by Developer 2), Hunter tier strategies

#### Implementation Details from Epic

Based on Epic 10 requirements, the VWAP execution strategy must:

1. **Inherit from BaseStrategy:** Use `genesis.strategies.base.BaseStrategy` as the parent class
2. **Use existing models:** Import from `genesis.core.models` (Order, Signal, etc.)
3. **Integrate with risk engine:** Signals must be validated by `genesis.risk.risk_engine`
4. **Support Strategist tier:** This is a $10k+ capital strategy requiring institutional-grade execution

#### Code Structure Requirements

```python
# Import structure based on architecture
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from decimal import Decimal

from genesis.strategies.base import BaseStrategy
from genesis.core.models import Order, OrderType, Signal
from genesis.analytics.market_analyzer import MarketAnalyzer

import structlog
logger = structlog.get_logger()
```

#### Volume Curve Estimation Algorithm

The VolumeCurveEstimator should:
- Analyze historical intraday volume patterns over the last 20 trading days
- Create normalized volume distribution curves by time of day
- Account for special market conditions (opens, closes, events)
- Update curves dynamically based on real-time volume

#### Order Slicing Parameters

- **Minimum slice size:** Based on exchange minimum order requirements
- **Maximum slice size:** 10% of average volume in time window
- **Slice count:** Optimized based on parent order size and time horizon
- **Distribution:** Follow volume curve unless urgency overrides

#### Urgency Levels

1. **Low (0-25%):** Follow volume curve strictly
2. **Medium (26-50%):** Moderate acceleration, up to 1.5x normal rate
3. **High (51-75%):** Aggressive execution, up to 2x normal rate
4. **Critical (76-100%):** Maximum speed within participation limits
5. **Emergency:** Override all constraints, immediate execution

#### Performance Requirements

- Execution latency: <50ms per child order
- Volume curve calculation: <100ms
- Schedule generation: <20ms
- Memory usage: <100MB per parent order
- Support for 100+ concurrent parent orders

### Testing Standards

From `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`:
- Test files location: `tests/unit/` and `tests/integration/`
- Test file naming: `test_*.py`
- Testing framework: pytest
- Coverage requirement: >85% for new code
- Mock exchanges using `tests/mocks/mock_exchange.py`
- Use fixtures for common test data
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Include edge cases and boundary conditions

### Integration Points

1. **Market Data:** Subscribe to real-time volume data via `genesis.exchange.gateway`
2. **Risk Engine:** All child orders validated through `genesis.risk.risk_engine`
3. **Order Management:** Use `genesis.engine.executor` for order submission
4. **Performance Tracking:** Report metrics to `genesis.analytics.metrics`
5. **State Management:** Persist state via `genesis.data.repository`

## Validation and Testing Instructions

### Pre-Implementation Validation
1. Verify BaseStrategy interface compatibility
2. Confirm exchange API supports required order types
3. Validate volume data availability for target symbols

### Unit Testing Requirements
- Test volume curve estimation with various market conditions
- Test order slicing with different parent order sizes
- Test schedule generation under all urgency levels
- Test participation rate limit enforcement
- Test emergency mode activation and execution
- Mock all external dependencies

### Integration Testing Requirements  
- End-to-end execution flow with mock exchange
- Verify child order aggregation equals parent order
- Test VWAP benchmark tracking accuracy
- Measure actual vs expected market impact
- Test failover and error recovery scenarios

### Performance Validation
- Benchmark with 1000 historical volume profiles
- Test with 100 concurrent parent orders
- Measure memory usage under load
- Verify <50ms latency requirement

## Security Considerations

1. **Order Validation:** Validate all order parameters before submission
2. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limits to prevent exchange bans
3. **Error Handling:** Never expose internal errors to logs
4. **State Protection:** Encrypt sensitive strategy state
5. **Access Control:** Restrict strategy modification to authorized roles
