### Backup and Storage Configuration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#cloud-infrastructure]

- **Backup Tool**: restic 0.16.3 for encrypted backups (MVP tier)
- **Database**: SQLite 3.45.0 with WAL mode and atomic transactions
- **Future Migration**: PostgreSQL 16.1 at $2k+ tier with time-series optimization

### Database Schema and Event Sourcing
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md#immutable-event-store]
- Events table provides complete audit trail for reconstruction
- Event fields: event_id (UUID), event_type, aggregate_id, event_data (JSON)
- Sequence numbers ensure event ordering for replay

### Error Handling and Resilience
[Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md]
- Exponential backoff for retries: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, max 30s
- Circuit breaker: Open after 5 failures in 30s, half-open after 60s
- Timeout configuration: Connect 5s, Read 10s, Total 30s
- Compensation logic for rollback procedures
- Idempotency using client order IDs

### Logging and Audit Requirements
[Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#logging-standards]
- Structured logging with structlog 24.1.0
- JSON format with mandatory fields: timestamp, level, component, error_type, context
- Correlation ID (UUID) per operation chain
- Levels: INFO (normal), WARNING (degraded), ERROR (failure), CRITICAL (money at risk)
- All DR operations must be logged at INFO level minimum
- Emergency actions logged at CRITICAL level

### Integration with Existing Systems
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#architectural-patterns]
- Event Bus integration for real-time DR status updates
- Repository pattern for database abstraction (backup both SQLite and future PostgreSQL)
- State machine pattern integration for tier-appropriate recovery
- Event sourcing for complete position reconstruction
- Circuit breaker for S3/Spaces API calls

### Performance and Uptime Requirements
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]
- 99.5% uptime requirement (must support this with DR)
- <100ms execution path (DR operations run async/background)
- RTO: 15 minutes maximum recovery time
- RPO: 5 minutes maximum data loss window

### Security Considerations
From Story 7.3 context (visible in git status):
- Encrypted backups using restic with AES-256
- API key rotation for S3/Spaces access
- Audit logging for all DR operations
- Network segmentation for backup traffic
- TLS encryption for replication traffic
