## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Story 8.3 implemented comprehensive error handling with GlobalErrorHandler, custom exception hierarchy, and retry decorators. The error handling infrastructure is now in place and can be leveraged for handling security-related errors and failures.

### Existing Security Implementation
**Current Vault Integration** [Source: architecture/security/vault-setup.md, security/vault_client.py]
- Genesis already has HashiCorp Vault integration in `genesis/security/vault_client.py`
- Secret paths structure:
  - `/genesis/exchange/api-keys` - Trading and read-only API credentials
  - `/genesis/database/encryption-key` - Database encryption keys
  - `/genesis/tls/certificates` - TLS certificates
  - `/genesis/backup/encryption-key` - Backup encryption keys
- TTL-based caching (1 hour default) implemented
- Dual-key strategy for API rotation already designed

**Database Encryption** [Source: architecture/security/encryption.md, data/encrypted_database.py]
- SQLCipher integration exists in `genesis/data/encrypted_database.py`
- Fernet symmetric encryption (256-bit keys) already implemented
- Encrypted columns: `api_key`, `api_secret`, `password`, `token`, `private_key`, `secret`, `credential`
- AES-256 encryption standard in use

### File Locations
- Main configuration: `genesis/config/settings.py`
- Existing Vault client: `genesis/security/vault_client.py`
- Database encryption: `genesis/data/encrypted_database.py`
- Authentication: `genesis/api/auth.py`
- New SecretsManager: `genesis/security/secrets_manager.py` (to be created)
- Master key storage: `~/.genesis/.secrets/master.key` (to be created)

### Configuration Settings
**Environment Variables** [Source: architecture/config/settings.py]
```python
GENESIS_VAULT_URL       # HashiCorp Vault URL
GENESIS_VAULT_TOKEN     # HashiCorp Vault token
GENESIS_USE_VAULT       # Enable/disable Vault
BINANCE_API_KEY         # Development fallback
BINANCE_API_SECRET      # Development fallback

- Test file location: `tests/unit/test_secrets_manager.py`, `tests/integration/test_api_rotation.py`
- Required coverage: 100% for security modules
- Testing framework: pytest with pytest-asyncio
- Security test scenarios:
  - Key rotation during active trading
  - Permission enforcement across all roles
  - Vault failover and recovery
  - Encryption/decryption operations
  - Pre-commit hook validation
- Use existing test fixtures from `tests/fixtures/`
- Mock external services (Vault, AWS) for unit tests

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-31

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Implementation: EXCELLENT**

The security infrastructure implementation demonstrates enterprise-grade quality with comprehensive multi-backend secrets management, zero-downtime API key rotation, HSM support foundation, and SOC 2 compliance mechanisms. The code follows security best practices with proper encryption, audit logging, and error handling throughout.

**Key Strengths:**
- Multi-backend architecture (Vault, AWS, Local) with clean abstraction
- Robust encryption using Fernet/AES-256 with secure key management
- Comprehensive audit trail with tamper-proof hash chains
- Zero-knowledge architecture with Shamir's Secret Sharing
- Excellent test coverage with unit and integration tests
- Pre-commit hooks properly configured for secret scanning

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: genesis/security/secrets_manager.py
  - **Change**: Fixed async iteration issue in AWS backend list_secrets method
  - **Why**: The original code incorrectly used `async for` with `asyncio.to_thread` which doesn't support async iteration
  - **How**: Changed to synchronously collect all pages in thread pool, then iterate over results, ensuring proper async/await pattern

### Compliance Check

### Security Review

**Strengths:**
- No hardcoded secrets found
- Proper use of environment variable fallbacks
- Secure file permissions (0600) for sensitive files
- Master key generation with proper entropy
- Audit logging cannot be disabled or tampered with

### Performance Considerations

- TTL-based caching (1 hour default) reduces backend calls
- Async operations throughout prevent blocking
- Efficient pagination handling for large secret lists
- Background tasks for key rotation minimize impact
