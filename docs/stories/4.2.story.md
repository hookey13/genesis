);
```

**Positions Table Extensions** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
- Index for emergency close: `CREATE INDEX idx_positions_priority ON positions(priority_score DESC) WHERE closed_at IS NULL`
- Supports multiple open positions per account

### Component Specifications
**Risk Engine Component** [Source: architecture/components.md]
- Located in `genesis/engine/risk_engine.py`
- Key Interfaces:
  - `calculate_position_size(balance: Decimal, risk_percent: Decimal) -> Decimal`
  - `check_risk_limits(position: Position) -> RiskDecision`
  - `calculate_portfolio_risk() -> PortfolioRisk`
  - `get_correlation_matrix() -> np.array`
- Must validate all positions before execution

**Event Bus Component** [Source: architecture/components.md]
- Priority lanes for different event types
- Methods:
  - `publish(event: Event, priority: Priority) -> None`
  - `subscribe(event_type: str, handler: Callable, priority: Priority) -> None`

**Market Data Service** [Source: architecture/components.md]
- `get_current_price(symbol: str) -> Decimal`
- `get_order_book(symbol: str, depth: int) -> OrderBook`
- `classify_market_state(symbol: str) -> MarketState`

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- Multi-pair manager: `genesis/engine/executor/multi_pair.py`
- Signal queue: `genesis/engine/signal_queue.py`
- Correlation monitor: `genesis/analytics/behavior_correlation.py`
- Performance tracker: `genesis/analytics/pair_performance.py`

- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_*.py`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_multi_pair_workflow.py`
- Database migration: `alembic/versions/007_add_multi_pair_trading_tables.py`

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Python 3.11.8 exclusively - no Python 3.12 features
- Decimal from decimal module for all money calculations (NEVER use float)
- asyncio for all I/O operations
- ccxt 4.2.25 for exchange interaction
- numpy for correlation matrix calculations
- structlog 24.1.0 for structured logging

**Coding Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Classes: PascalCase (e.g., `MultiPairManager`)
- Functions: snake_case (e.g., `calculate_pair_correlation`)
- Money variables: Suffix with currency (e.g., `position_value_usdt`)
- Time variables: Suffix with unit (e.g., `window_minutes`)
- ALWAYS use idempotency keys for orders
- ALWAYS use database transactions for multi-step operations
- NEVER modify tier without state machine
- Decimal precision for all monetary values

**Tier Requirements** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- HUNTER Tier ($2k-$10k): Required for multi-pair trading
- Supports 5+ concurrent positions
- Correlation management enabled
- Advanced risk controls available

### Risk Management Rules
**Correlation Thresholds** [Source: architecture/components.md]
- >60% correlation: Triggers risk alert
- >80% correlation: Requires position size adjustment
- Correlation calculation uses configurable time windows

**Position Limits** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- Per-pair limits enforced by tier
- Global portfolio limits based on account balance
- Emergency liquidation uses priority_score for ordering

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Framework: pytest 8.0.0 with pytest-asyncio
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_{module}.py`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_{workflow}.py`
- Coverage requirement: 100% for money-path code
- Database testing: In-memory SQLite for speed
- Mocking: pytest-mock with faker for test data

**Critical Test Scenarios:**
- Opening exactly 5 concurrent positions
- Opening 6+ positions to verify support
- Per-pair limit enforcement
- Global portfolio limit enforcement
- Correlation calculation accuracy
- Correlation alert at 60% threshold
- Risk adjustment at 80% correlation
- Signal queue priority ordering
- Competing signals for same pair
- Capital allocation with insufficient funds
- Performance attribution calculation
- Tier gate enforcement (Sniper tier rejection)
- Portfolio drawdown monitoring
- Emergency liquidation priority

**Test File Locations:**
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_multi_pair_manager.py`
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_behavior_correlation.py`
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_signal_queue.py`
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_pair_performance.py`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_multi_pair_workflow.py`
- Migration tests: `tests/unit/test_migration_007.py`

**Testing Patterns:**
- Use `pytest.mark.asyncio` for async test methods
- Use `@pytest.fixture` for test data builders
- Mock exchange responses with VCR.py
- Assert using pytest assertions, not unittest
- Test edge cases around limits and thresholds
