- **Tier restrictions:** Use `@requires_tier(TradingTier.HUNTER)` decorator for Hunter+ features
- **Naming conventions:** Classes use PascalCase, functions use snake_case
- **Money variables:** Suffix with currency (e.g., `allocation_usdt`)
- **Time variables:** Suffix with unit (e.g., `window_seconds`)
- **Context managers:** Use for resource cleanup
- **Database transactions:** Use for multi-step operations

### Existing Analytics Module Patterns
From reviewing existing analytics files:
- Dataclasses used for result objects (see `KellyParams`, `StrategyEdge` in kelly_sizing.py)
- Proper tier decorators on public methods
- Caching with TTL for expensive calculations
- Comprehensive logging using structlog
- scipy.stats used for statistical calculations where needed
- Clear separation of calculation logic from data access

- Performance requirement: Optimization calculations < 1 second for 10 strategies
- Memory efficient: Cache invalidation after 1 hour
