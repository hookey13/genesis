### Architecture Alignment
**From Epic 10 PRD:**
- Spread tracking essential for opportunity validation
- Liquidity assessment for position sizing
- Market microstructure analysis for anomaly detection
- Feed data to strategies for decision making
- Performance requirement: <2ms processing

**Spread Metrics:**
- Quoted spread: (ask - bid) / midpoint * 10000 (bps)
- Effective spread: 2 * |price - midpoint| / midpoint * 10000
- Realized spread: 2 * (price - future_midpoint) / midpoint * 10000
- Time-weighted: Σ(spread_i * time_i) / Σ(time_i)
- Volume-weighted: Σ(spread_i * volume_i) / Σ(volume_i)

**Liquidity Metrics:**
- Depth: Sum of volumes at each price level
- Imbalance: (bid_volume - ask_volume) / (bid_volume + ask_volume)
- Market impact: √(order_size / average_daily_volume) * volatility
- Liquidity score: weighted combination of depth, spread, volatility

**Key Dependencies:**
- `numpy` for numerical calculations
- `pandas` for time series operations (if needed)
- `scipy.stats` for statistical functions
- Reuse existing models and websocket feeds

**Integration Points:**
- Market Analyzer: Shares spread data
- Arbitrage Detector: Uses liquidity scores
- Risk Engine: Uses for position sizing
- Strategies: Consume liquidity metrics

### Implementation Guidelines
1. Use numpy arrays for efficient calculations
2. Implement rolling windows with collections.deque
3. Cache frequently accessed metrics
4. Use asyncio for concurrent updates
5. Log significant spread/liquidity changes at INFO
6. Implement exponential decay for historical weights
7. Handle missing data gracefully
8. Use median instead of mean for robust baselines

### Algorithm Details
**Spread Volatility:**
```python
# Using exponentially weighted moving average
volatility = np.sqrt(np.average(
    (spreads - mean_spread) ** 2,
    weights=exponential_weights
))
```

**Market Impact (Square-root model):**
```python
# Almgren-Chriss model
temporary_impact = eta * np.sqrt(order_size / adv)
permanent_impact = gamma * order_size / adv
total_impact = temporary_impact + permanent_impact
```

**Liquidity Score:**
```python
# Composite score (0-100)
depth_score = min(100, depth / target_depth * 100)
spread_score = max(0, 100 - spread_bps / 10)
volatility_score = max(0, 100 - volatility * 100)
liquidity_score = (
    depth_score * 0.4 +
    spread_score * 0.4 +
    volatility_score * 0.2
)
```

### Configuration Parameters
Default configuration:
- `spread_window`: 1000 (rolling window size)
- `baseline_period`: 3600 (seconds for baseline)
- `volatility_halflife`: 300 (seconds for EWMA)
- `depth_levels`: [5, 10, 20] (orderbook levels)
- `anomaly_threshold`: 3.0 (z-score for anomalies)
- `cache_ttl`: 60 (seconds for metric cache)
- `max_memory_mb`: 50 (memory limit)

### Memory Management
- Use deque with maxlen for rolling windows
- Implement periodic cleanup of old data
- Aggregate historical data to reduce storage
- Monitor memory usage and alert if exceeded

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates strong architectural design and comprehensive feature coverage. Both `EnhancedSpreadTracker` and `LiquidityAnalyzer` classes are well-structured with appropriate separation of concerns. The code follows async patterns correctly and implements thread-safe operations using asyncio locks. Data structures are efficiently designed using deques with maxlen for memory management.
