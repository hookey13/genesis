## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 6.4 (Market Microstructure Analysis):
- Successfully implemented microstructure analysis with order flow detection, large trader identification, and market manipulation detection
- All financial calculations continue to use Decimal for precision (never float)
- All timestamps use datetime.now(timezone.utc) consistently  
- Market microstructure repository established at genesis/data/market_microstructure_repo.py
- Order book manager created at genesis/exchange/order_book_manager.py
- Event-driven architecture with EventBus continues to work well for real-time updates
[Source: docs/stories/6.4.story.md#dev-agent-record]

### Data Models
**Account Model Enhancements:**
- Current structure already supports single account at account_id level
- Need to add parent_account_id field for sub-account support (nullable, UUID)
- Add account_type field: Enum[MASTER|SUB|PAPER]
- Add permissions JSON field for feature access control
- Add compliance_settings JSON field for regulatory requirements
- Maintain existing relationships: Has many Positions, Has many TradingSession, Has one TiltProfile
[Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#account]

**Position Model Tax Extensions:**
- Add tax_lot_id field (UUID) for lot tracking
- Add acquisition_date (DateTime) for holding period calculations  
- Add cost_basis field (Decimal) separate from entry_price
- Add tax_method field: Enum[FIFO|LIFO|HIFO|SPECIFIC_LOT]
- Maintain existing Decimal precision for all money fields
- Maintain existing relationships: Belongs to Account, Has many Orders, Has many TiltEvents
[Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#position]

**Event Model for Compliance:**
- Leverage existing immutable event store for audit trail
- event_type, aggregate_id, event_data already support compliance needs
- sequence_number ensures complete audit history
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#event-audit-trail]

### Component Specifications
**Analytics Engine Extensions:**
- Located in genesis/analytics/ directory
- Must integrate with existing PerformanceReport interface
- Subscribe to Event Bus (genesis/engine/event_bus.py) for real-time updates
- Use pandas 2.2.0 for data manipulation, numpy 1.26.3 for risk matrices
- All calculations must use Decimal for monetary values
- Risk metrics must update on position changes via event subscriptions
[Source: docs/architecture/components.md#analytics-engine]

**Data Repository Layer:**
- Abstract repository pattern already in place at genesis/data/repository.py
- SQLite implementation at genesis/data/sqlite_repo.py
- PostgreSQL ready at genesis/data/postgres_repo.py
- Use Alembic 1.13.1 for any schema migrations needed
- Add new repositories for multi-account: AccountRepository, ComplianceRepository
- Transaction isolation level: READ_COMMITTED for account operations
[Source: docs/architecture/components.md#data-repository-layer]

**Risk Engine Integration:**
- Existing interfaces: calculate_portfolio_risk(), get_correlation_matrix()
- Located at genesis/engine/risk_engine.py
- Must maintain Decimal precision for all calculations
- Add new methods for VaR/CVaR: calculate_var(confidence_level), calculate_cvar(confidence_level)
- Risk limits enforcement via check_risk_limits() method
- Integration with multi-account via account_id parameter

### Technical Constraints
- Python 3.11.8 - no 3.12 features allowed
- All money calculations MUST use Decimal (from decimal import Decimal), never float
- All async operations use asyncio, no blocking I/O in main thread
- Structured logging via structlog 24.1.0 with correlation IDs
- Database operations via SQLAlchemy 2.0.25 core (not ORM)
- Use datetime.now(timezone.utc) for all timestamps
- Handle database locks with retry logic (max 3 retries)
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]

### Implementation Dependencies
**Required Existing Modules:**
- genesis/core/models.py - Domain models to extend
- genesis/engine/event_bus.py - For real-time updates
- genesis/engine/risk_engine.py - Risk calculation base
- genesis/data/repository.py - Abstract repository pattern
- genesis/utils/decorators.py - For @requires_tier
- genesis/ui/app.py - Textual application for UI widgets

**External Libraries Required:**
- scipy 1.12.0 - For VaR/CVaR calculations
- pandas 2.2.0 - For time series analysis
- numpy 1.26.3 - For correlation matrices
- quickfix 1.15.1 - For FIX protocol (stub only)

### Security Considerations
- Multi-account data segregation via account_id filtering
- Compliance reports must sanitize sensitive data
- FIX credentials stored encrypted in environment variables
- Prime broker API keys in secure vault (not in code)
- Audit all account switches in Event store
- Rate limit compliance report generation
[Source: Security requirements from Epic 6.5]

### Project Structure Notes
- All new institutional features belong in Strategist tier ($10k+)
- Features must check tier via @requires_tier decorator from genesis/utils/decorators.py
- Use @requires_tier(Tier.STRATEGIST) on all institutional feature methods
- No modifications to core tier state machine required
- Maintain separation between tiers in directory structure
- Store institutional-specific strategies in genesis/strategies/strategist/
- Configuration in config/tier_gates.yaml for feature gating
