```

### Component Specifications
**Order Executor Component** [Source: architecture/components.md#Order Executor]:
- Responsibility: Order placement, execution algorithms, and slicing logic
- Key Interfaces:
  - `execute_market_order(order: Order) -> ExecutionResult` - Simple market execution
  - `execute_iceberg_order(order: Order, slices: int) -> ExecutionResult` - Sliced execution (Hunter+ tier)
  - `execute_twap(order: Order, duration: int) -> ExecutionResult` - Time-weighted execution (Strategist+ tier)
  - `cancel_all_orders() -> None` - Emergency stop
- Dependencies: Exchange Gateway, Risk Engine, Tier State Machine
- Technology: Python asyncio, ccxt for exchange interaction

### API Specifications
**Binance API Integration** [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#Binance Spot Trading API]:
- Place Order: `POST /api/v3/order` with HMAC signature
- Cancel Order: `DELETE /api/v3/order` with order_id
- Query Status: `GET /api/v3/order` to verify execution
- Rate Limits: 50 orders per 10 seconds, 1200 requests per minute
- Use recvWindow of 5000ms for time synchronization
- Implement circuit breaker with exponential backoff

### File Locations
Based on [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- Order executor base: `genesis/engine/executor/base.py` (new file)
- Market order executor: `genesis/engine/executor/market.py` (new file)
- Order models extension: `genesis/core/models.py` (extend existing)
- Custom exceptions: `genesis/core/exceptions.py` (extend with SlippageAlert)
- Database models: `genesis/data/models_db.py` (add Order model)
- SQLite operations: `genesis/data/sqlite_repo.py` (add order CRUD)
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_executor.py` (new file)
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_order_flow.py` (new file)

### Technical Constraints
**Critical Money Handling** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Critical Rules]:
- **NEVER use float for money** - Always use Decimal from decimal module
- All order prices and quantities must use Decimal
- Round to 8 decimal places for crypto quantities
- Round to 2 decimal places for USD values

**Idempotency Requirements** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Critical Rules]:
- **ALWAYS use idempotency keys** - Every order must have a client_order_id
- Generate UUID for client_order_id before submission
- Store client_order_id in database for duplicate detection
- Prevent duplicate orders even if retried

**Error Handling** [Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md]:
- Circuit breaker pattern for exchange failures
- Exponential backoff: 2^n seconds, max 60s
- Custom exceptions: SlippageAlert, OrderExecutionFailed
- Use structlog for JSON logging with correlation IDs
- Database transactions must be atomic (all or nothing)

### Core Workflow
**Order Execution Flow** [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#Order Execution Flow]:
1. User command parsed by Terminal UI
2. Tier State Machine checks permissions (SNIPER allows market orders)
3. Risk Engine calculates safe position size (5% rule)
4. Tilt Detector verifies psychological state
5. Order Executor places order via Exchange Gateway
6. Circuit breaker checks before API call
7. Binance API processes order
8. Post-execution verification of fill
9. Order status and position updated in database
10. OrderExecuted event published to Event Bus (HIGH priority)
11. Terminal UI displays confirmation to user

### Testing Requirements
