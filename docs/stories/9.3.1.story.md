            token=os.getenv('VAULT_TOKEN')
        )

    def get_database_credentials(self) -> Dict[str, str]:
        """Get dynamic PostgreSQL credentials"""
        response = self.client.secrets.database.generate_credentials(
            name='genesis-app',
            mount_point='genesis-database'

## Notes
This sub-story establishes the secure foundation for all secret management. Vault must be properly hardened before any secrets are migrated from the current insecure storage. The deployment uses Docker for consistency and includes auto-unseal capability using AWS KMS for production resilience.

Key implementation priorities:
1. Get Vault running with basic configuration
2. Enable and test all three secret engines
3. Apply security policies
4. Validate performance meets requirements
5. Setup monitoring and backup procedures
