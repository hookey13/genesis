### Architecture Context

**Technology Stack (from architecture docs):**
- Python 3.11.8 with asyncio for concurrent operations
- SQLite for MVP state persistence (upgrade to PostgreSQL at $2k+)
- structlog for structured logging
- decimal library for financial calculations
- In-memory caching with Python dicts and asyncio.Queue

**Performance Requirements:**
- Trading loop execution: <100ms per cycle
- Market data processing: <5ms per message
- Signal generation: <10ms per strategy
- Order execution latency: <50ms
- State persistence: checkpoint every 60 seconds

**Integration Points:**
- `genesis/exchange/gateway.py` - Market data and order execution
- `genesis/engine/risk_engine.py` - Signal validation
- `genesis/engine/state_machine.py` - Tier state management
- `genesis/strategies/loader.py` - Dynamic strategy loading
- `genesis/tilt/detector.py` - Behavioral monitoring integration

**Error Handling Requirements:**
- Circuit breaker pattern for exchange failures
- Exponential backoff for retries (initial: 100ms, max: 30s)
- Graceful degradation when components fail
- State recovery from last checkpoint
- Emergency stop with position liquidation

### Code Patterns to Follow

**Async/Await Pattern:**
```python
async def process_market_data(self, data: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
    """Process incoming market data asynchronously."""
    try:
        validated_data = await self.validate_data(data)
        await self.update_cache(validated_data)
        await self.notify_strategies(validated_data)
    except ValidationError as e:
        logger.warning("data_validation_failed", error=str(e))
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error("market_data_processing_error", error=str(e))
        await self.circuit_breaker.record_failure()
```

**State Machine Integration:**
```python
@requires_state(EngineState.RUNNING)
async def execute_trade(self, signal: Signal) -> Order:
    """Execute trade with state validation."""
    # Implementation
```

**Structured Logging:**
```python
logger.info(
    "trade_executed",
    strategy=strategy_name,
    symbol=symbol,
    side=side,
    quantity=quantity,
    price=price,
    latency_ms=latency
)
```
