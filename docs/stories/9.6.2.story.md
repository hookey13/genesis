## Dev Notes

### Existing Infrastructure Context
The Genesis project already has basic OpenTelemetry setup in `genesis/monitoring/opentelemetry_tracing.py`. The implementation includes:
- OpenTelemetryTracer class with OTLP exporter configuration
- Basic instrumentation for FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and aiohttp (if available)
- Context propagation with correlation IDs
- Sampling configuration based on environment (production vs development)

### Jaeger Deployment Configuration
```yaml
# docker-compose.jaeger.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  jaeger-collector:
    image: jaegertracing/jaeger-collector:1.54
    environment:
      - SPAN_STORAGE_TYPE=elasticsearch
      - ES_SERVER_URLS=http://elasticsearch:9200
    ports:
      - "14250:14250"  # gRPC
      - "14268:14268"  # HTTP
      - "14269:14269"  # Health check
    depends_on:
      - elasticsearch

  jaeger-query:
    image: jaegertracing/jaeger-query:1.54
    environment:
      - SPAN_STORAGE_TYPE=elasticsearch
      - ES_SERVER_URLS=http://elasticsearch:9200
    ports:
      - "16686:16686"  # Jaeger UI
      - "16687:16687"  # Health check

  elasticsearch:
    image: elasticsearch:7.17.9
    environment:
      - discovery.type=single-node
      - ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx512m
    volumes:
      - jaeger-elastic-data:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data
```

### OpenTelemetry Integration Points
1. **Trading Operations**: Wrap all order placement, cancellation, and execution in spans
2. **Market Data**: Create spans for market data processing and distribution
3. **Database Operations**: Already instrumented via SQLAlchemy, ensure proper span naming
4. **External APIs**: Add spans for all exchange API calls with retry tracking
5. **WebSocket Connections**: Create long-running spans for WebSocket lifecycle

### Sampling Strategy Implementation
```python
# In genesis/monitoring/opentelemetry_tracing.py
class AdaptiveSampler:
    def should_sample(self, span_context, attributes):
        # Always sample errors
        if attributes.get('error', False):
            return True
        # Always sample slow requests
        if attributes.get('latency_ms', 0) > 100:
            return True
        # Sample 1% of normal traffic
        return random.random() < 0.01
```

### Performance Requirements
- Trace collection latency: <1ms overhead per span
- Storage requirements: ~1KB per trace (estimate 1GB/day at full load)
- Query performance: <2s for trace search across 7 days
- Dashboard refresh rate: Real-time (<5s delay)

### Testing

#### Unit Tests
- Test span creation and attributes
- Verify context propagation
- Test sampling logic
- Validate error capture

#### Integration Tests
- End-to-end trace flow test
- Cross-service correlation test
- Jaeger backend connectivity test
- Performance overhead measurement

#### Load Tests
- Verify <1% performance impact under load
- Test trace storage capacity
- Validate sampling accuracy
- Stress test Jaeger query performance

│   └── test_opentelemetry_tracing.py
├── integration/
│   └── test_distributed_tracing.py

```

### Security Considerations
- Use TLS for all OTLP communications in production
- Sanitize sensitive data from span attributes (no passwords, API keys)
- Implement access controls for Jaeger UI
- Regular rotation of collector certificates
- Audit logging for trace access

### Configuration Management
All tracing configuration should be managed through environment variables:
```bash
# .env
OTLP_ENDPOINT=jaeger-collector:4317
OTLP_SECURE=true
TRACE_SAMPLING_RATE=0.01
JAEGER_UI_URL=https://traces.genesis.internal
TRACE_RETENTION_DAYS=7
```
