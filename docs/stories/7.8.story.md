## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 7.7 Dev Agent Record]
- Comprehensive testing frameworks built with async patterns
- Pydantic used for type-safe configuration throughout
- Stress testing infrastructure established in tests/stress/
- All components have comprehensive test coverage after QA fixes

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#position-model]
- Position model tracks: pnl_dollars (Decimal), pnl_percent (Decimal), entry_price, current_price, quantity, dollar_value, opened_at, closed_at timestamps, close_reason (stop_loss|take_profit|manual|tilt_intervention)

[Source: architecture/data-models.md#order-model]
- Order model supports: slice_number, total_slices for iceberg orders, filled_quantity vs quantity for partial fills, executed_at timestamps for FIFO/LIFO calculations, latency_ms and slippage_percent tracking

[Source: architecture/data-models.md#trading-session-model]
- TradingSession model for grouping trades: starting_balance, ending_balance, total_trades, winning_trades, losing_trades, max_drawdown calculations

### Database Schema
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md#events-table]
- Immutable event store with: event_id (UUID), event_type, aggregate_id, aggregate_type, event_data (JSON), event_metadata (JSON context), created_at timestamp, sequence_number for ordering
- Indexes on aggregate_id, event_type, and created_at for forensic queries

[Source: architecture/database-schema.md#positions-table]
- Position table with CHECK constraints for balance >= 0 and valid date ranges
- Indexes on account_id, opened_at for performance queries

[Source: architecture/database-schema.md#orders-table]
- Orders table with client_order_id for idempotency
- Status tracking: PENDING, PARTIAL, FILLED, CANCELLED, FAILED
- Price and quantity with DECIMAL(20,8) precision

[Source: architecture/database-schema.md#decimal-precision]
- Financial precision with DECIMAL(20,8) for prices and quantities
- DECIMAL(10,4) for percentages and rates

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#analytics-directory]
- Analytics module at genesis/analytics/: metrics.py (performance calculations), forensics.py (event replay and analysis), reports.py (report generation)

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#data-layer]
- Data layer at genesis/data/: repository.py (abstract repository), sqlite_repo.py, postgres_repo.py (implementations), models_db.py (SQLAlchemy models)

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#utils/logger]
- Structured logging with structlog at genesis/utils/logger.py
- Audit logs stored in .genesis/logs/audit.log (all events)

[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#backup-infrastructure]
- Backup script at scripts/backup.sh for DigitalOcean Spaces
- Local backups stored in .genesis/data/backups/

### Technical Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Python 3.11.8 (no 3.12 features)
- Database: SQLite for MVP, PostgreSQL 16.1 for production
- Testing Framework: pytest 8.0.0 with pytest-asyncio
- Serialization: JSON (stdlib) for MVP, MessagePack for $10k+ phase
- Async Framework: asyncio (stdlib) for concurrent I/O operations

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#database-evolution]
- Phased database approach: SQLite (MVP) â†’ PostgreSQL ($2k+)
- Alembic migrations for schema evolution at alembic/versions/

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
- NEVER use float for money, always use Decimal
- Database transactions mandatory for multi-step operations
- Idempotency keys required for every order (client_order_id)

### Event Sourcing & Audit Trail
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#event-sourcing]
- Event Sourcing pattern: All state changes recorded as events for reconstruction
- Provides complete audit trail for forensic analysis

[Source: architecture/database-schema.md#schema-version-tracking]
- Schema version tracking with rollback capabilities: migration_name, applied_at, checksum, rollback_sql

[Source: architecture/database-schema.md#pragma-settings]
- SQLite configured with WAL mode and NORMAL synchronous for durability
- Foreign key constraints enabled for referential integrity

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#coverage-goals]
- Coverage requirements: 100% for money paths, 90% for risk/tilt
- Unit tests at tests/unit/ with pytest framework
- Integration tests at tests/integration/ for component interactions

### Project Structure Notes
- New compliance module to be created at genesis/compliance/ for GDPR and regulatory functions
- New operations module already exists at genesis/operations/ from Story 7.6
- Documentation for compliance to be created in new docs/compliance/ directory
- Tax lot tracking will require new database migration in alembic/versions/

## Testing

### Test File Locations
- Unit tests: tests/unit/test_trade_reporting.py, test_tax_lots.py, test_pnl_reports.py, test_data_retention.py
- Integration tests: tests/integration/test_audit_trail.py

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- Use pytest 8.0.0 with pytest-asyncio for async operations
- Achieve 100% coverage for money-related paths
- Mock external dependencies (exchange APIs)
- Use fixtures from tests/conftest.py
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Verify Decimal precision for all financial calculations

### Testing Patterns
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Create test fixtures for compliance data
- Test audit trail immutability
- Verify report generation accuracy
- Test data retention policy enforcement
- Validate FIFO/LIFO calculations with known examples
