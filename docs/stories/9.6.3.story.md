### Integration with Parent Story Infrastructure

From Story 9.6, we have the monitoring stack already running in Docker:
- **Prometheus** on port 9090 - Will scrape our SLO metrics
- **Grafana** on port 3000 - Will display SLO dashboards
- **AlertManager** on port 9093 - Will handle our alert routing
- **Jaeger** on port 16686 - Provides trace data for SLI calculation

### SLO Configuration Example
```yaml
# config/slo_definitions.yaml
services:
  trading_api:
    slis:
      availability:
        metric: up{job="trading_api"}
        threshold: 0.999  # 99.9% uptime
      latency:
        metric: http_request_duration_seconds{quantile="0.99"}
        threshold: 0.1  # 100ms p99
      error_rate:
        metric: http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}
        threshold: 0.001  # 0.1% error rate
    error_budget:
      window: 30d
      burn_rate_thresholds:
        - rate: 14.4  # 1 hour fast burn
          severity: critical
        - rate: 6     # 6 hour medium burn
          severity: warning
```

### Alert Channel Configuration
```python
# genesis/monitoring/alert_channels.py
from typing import Dict, Any
import aiohttp
from genesis.security.vault_client import VaultClient

class AlertChannelManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vault = VaultClient()
        self.channels = {
            'pagerduty': self._send_pagerduty,
            'slack': self._send_slack,
            'email': self._send_email
        }

    async def _send_pagerduty(self, alert: Dict[str, Any]):
        api_key = await self.vault.get_secret('pagerduty_api_key')
        routing_key = await self.vault.get_secret('pagerduty_routing_key')

        payload = {
            'routing_key': routing_key,
            'event_action': 'trigger',
            'payload': {
                'summary': alert['summary'],
                'severity': alert['severity'],
                'source': 'genesis-monitoring',
                'custom_details': alert['labels']
            }
        }

        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            headers = {
                'Authorization': f'Token token={api_key}',
                'Content-Type': 'application/json'
            }
            await session.post(
                'https://events.pagerduty.com/v2/enqueue',
                json=payload,
                headers=headers
            )
```

### Runbook Automation Example
```yaml
# monitoring/runbooks/high_latency.yaml
name: high_latency_remediation
description: Automated response to high latency alerts
trigger:
  alert_name: HighLatency
  severity: warning
conditions:
  - metric: genesis_order_latency_seconds
    operator: ">"
    value: 0.5
actions:
  - name: scale_workers
    type: kubernetes
    command: |
      kubectl scale deployment trading-engine --replicas=5
  - name: clear_cache
    type: http
    url: http://localhost:8000/api/admin/cache/clear
    method: POST
  - name: notify_team
    type: slack
    channel: "#ops-alerts"
    message: "Auto-scaled workers due to high latency"
```

### Testing Standards

From architecture documentation, tests should:
- Be located in `tests/integration/test_monitoring.py` and `tests/unit/test_slo_*.py`
- Use pytest framework with async support
- Mock external services (PagerDuty, Slack) in unit tests
- Use test containers for integration tests with real Prometheus/AlertManager
- Achieve >90% code coverage for monitoring components
- Include performance tests to ensure <1% overhead

### Security Considerations

1. **Secret Management**: All API keys and webhook URLs stored in HashiCorp Vault
2. **Authentication**: Alert webhook endpoint requires JWT authentication
3. **Authorization**: Role-based access for SLO configuration changes
4. **Audit Logging**: All alert actions and runbook executions logged
5. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limits on alert channels to prevent spam
6. **TLS**: All external alert channel communications use TLS 1.3+

### Performance Requirements

- SLI calculation latency: <10ms
- Alert delivery latency: <30 seconds
- SLO report generation: <5 seconds
- Monitoring overhead: <1% CPU, <50MB RAM
- Alert deduplication efficiency: >95% reduction in duplicate alerts

## Testing

### Unit Tests
```python
# tests/unit/test_slo_tracker.py
- Test SLI calculation accuracy
- Test error budget burn rate calculations
- Test alert threshold triggering
- Mock Prometheus queries

# tests/unit/test_alert_channels.py
- Test each channel delivery (mocked)
- Test retry logic with exponential backoff
- Test channel failure handling
```

### Integration Tests
```python
# tests/integration/test_alerting_e2e.py
- Deploy test monitoring stack
- Generate synthetic alerts
- Verify alert routing to correct channels
- Test alert acknowledgment flow
- Validate incident creation and tracking
```

### Performance Tests
```python
# tests/performance/test_slo_overhead.py
- Measure SLI calculation performance
- Test with 1000+ concurrent SLO evaluations
- Verify <1% CPU overhead
- Stress test alert deduplication
```

### Validation Steps
1. Trigger test alerts for each severity level
2. Verify alerts reach configured channels within 30 seconds
3. Confirm SLO dashboards display accurate data
4. Test runbook automation with dry-run mode
5. Validate error budget calculations match expected values
6. Ensure incident tracking captures all alert lifecycle events

## Notes
This story completes the observability trilogy (Metrics → Tracing → Alerting) by adding the critical alerting and SLO tracking layer. It transforms raw metrics and traces into actionable insights with automated responses.

Key implementation priorities:
1. **Accuracy over speed** - Ensure SLO calculations are correct
2. **Reliability over features** - Alert delivery must be bulletproof
3. **Security first** - All integrations must use secure credentials from vault
4. **Operational excellence** - Focus on reducing false positives and alert fatigue

The SLO framework follows Google's SRE methodology with multi-window, multi-burn-rate alerting to balance between detecting real issues quickly and avoiding alert fatigue.
