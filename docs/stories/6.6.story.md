- Use pytest 8.0.0 with pytest-asyncio 0.23.3 for async tests
- Mock external dependencies with pytest-mock 3.12.0
- 100% coverage for all critical path components
- Test Decimal precision preservation - never use float
- Use `unittest.mock` for Binance API calls

**Integration Testing:**
- Test files in `tests/integration/` for workflow testing
- Use in-memory SQLite for database tests
- VCR.py for recorded API responses
- Docker compose for full system tests
- Test data in `tests/fixtures/` directory

**Stress Testing:**
- New directory `tests/stress/` for load testing
- Simulate high-frequency market data updates
- Test with 100+ concurrent strategies
- Memory and CPU profiling during tests
- Network failure simulation tests

### Test Execution Plan
1. Run all existing unit tests to establish baseline
2. Execute new integration test suites in sequence
3. Run 24-hour stability test in test environment
4. Execute 48-hour production simulation
5. Generate comprehensive test report
6. Review and sign-off before production

## Notes for Implementer

**CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **Test Isolation**: Each test MUST be completely isolated - use fresh database, clean state
2. **Async Handling**: All async operations must use `pytest.mark.asyncio` decorator
3. **Decimal Precision**: NEVER use float in financial calculations or assertions
4. **Time Sensitivity**: Use `freezegun` for time-dependent tests
5. **Mock Carefully**: Mock external APIs but NOT internal components for integration tests
6. **Resource Cleanup**: Always cleanup resources in finally blocks or pytest fixtures

**Test Data Requirements:**
- Use realistic market data from `tests/fixtures/market_data.json`
- Generate test accounts with known balances
- Create predictable order scenarios for validation

**Performance Targets:**
- Unit tests: < 0.1 seconds per test
- Integration tests: < 5 seconds per test
- Full suite: < 10 minutes total
- Stability test: Zero crashes in 48 hours

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Document any flaky tests with mitigation
- Create runbook for test failure investigation
- Maintain test coverage reports in CI/CD

This story represents the final validation before production deployment. The implementation should create confidence that all Epic 6 capabilities work together seamlessly. Focus on realistic scenarios that would occur in production trading.
