# Story 10.10.1: End-to-End Integration Testing

**Status:** Ready for Review
**Epic:** Epic 10 - Core Trading Brain Implementation
**Type:** Parallel-Safe
**Branch:** feature/10-10-1
**Estimated Hours:** 8
**Developer Assignment:** Developer 2
**Implementation Readiness:** 10/10

## User Story
As a DevOps engineer,
I want comprehensive end-to-end integration tests for the complete trading flow,
So that we can validate all components work together correctly before production.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Complete trading flow test from signal to execution
2. Multi-strategy concurrent execution tests
3. Market data feed integration validation
4. Risk engine integration verification
5. State persistence and recovery tests
6. Error handling and recovery scenarios
7. Performance under load (1000+ orders/second)
8. Failover testing for critical components
9. Data integrity validation
10. Graceful shutdown verification

## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards (from architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md)
- **Framework:** pytest 8.0.0 with pytest-asyncio for async testing
- **Test Location:** `tests/` directory with subdirectories for unit, integration, e2e, and load
- **File Convention:** `test_{module}.py` naming pattern
- **Coverage Requirements:** 100% for money paths (trading engine, risk engine, executor)
- **Mocking:** pytest-mock with faker for test data generation
- **Test Database:** In-memory SQLite for speed in tests
- **External APIs:** VCR.py for recorded API responses

### Integration Points to Verify
- Gateway ↔ WebSocket Manager connection
- Trading Engine ↔ Strategy Registry interaction
- Risk Engine ↔ Trading Engine validation
- State Machine ↔ Trading Engine synchronization
- Database ↔ Repository pattern persistence
- Tilt Detector ↔ Trading Engine monitoring

### Critical Test Paths
1. **Signal Generation → Validation → Execution → Fill**
2. **Market Data → Analysis → Opportunity → Signal**
3. **Position Opening → Monitoring → Exit Signal → Closure**
4. **System Start → Trading → Error → Recovery → Resume**
5. **Normal Operation → Shutdown → State Save → Restart → State Restore**

### Test Scenarios
- Normal trading flow with multiple strategies
- High load conditions (1000+ orders/second)
- Component failures (exchange, database, cache)
- Network disruptions and reconnection
- Data corruption detection and recovery
- State recovery after system restart
- Concurrent strategy execution
- Risk limit enforcement
- Circuit breaker activation
- Graceful degradation under stress

### Performance Targets
- Throughput: 1000+ orders/second
- Latency: <50ms end-to-end
- Uptime: 99.9% availability
- Data Loss: Zero tolerance
- Recovery Time: <5 minutes MTTR
- Memory: <2GB under load
- CPU: <50% with 10 strategies
