## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 8.7 (Rate Limiting & Circuit Breakers):
- Comprehensive rate limiting and circuit breaker patterns implemented
- Integration tests revealed method signature mismatches that would have caused runtime errors
- Runtime integration tests were added to prevent regression (test_method_signatures.py)
- Alerting integration implemented for rate limit metrics
- Key lesson: Runtime validation tests are critical for catching integration issues

### Architecture Context

#### Tech Stack
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Testing Framework**: pytest 8.0.0 with pytest-asyncio for async test support
- **Coverage Tool**: pytest-cov 4.1.0 for coverage reporting
- **Mocking**: pytest-mock with faker for test data generation
- **Code Quality**: black 24.1.1 (formatter), ruff 0.1.14 (linter), mypy 1.8.0 (type checker)
- **Security Testing**: pip-audit for dependencies, Bandit for static analysis
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing on push

#### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Test Pyramid**: 70% unit (fast/isolated), 20% integration (workflows), 10% end-to-end
- **Coverage Goals**: 100% for money paths, 90% for risk/tilt, 70% for UI/analytics
- **File Convention**: `test_{module}.py` naming in same structure as source
- **Unit Test Location**: `tests/unit/` mirrors `genesis/` structure
- **Integration Test Location**: `tests/integration/` for component interactions
- **Test Infrastructure**:
  - Database: In-memory SQLite for speed
  - Message Queue: Python queues instead of Redis for tests
  - External APIs: VCR.py for recorded responses
- **Test Data**: Builder pattern, fixtures in `tests/fixtures/`, object mothers for scenarios

#### Critical Implementation Notes
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- NEVER use float for money - always use Decimal
- ALWAYS use asyncio for all I/O operations
- ALWAYS catch specific exceptions, never bare except
- Type hints are mandatory for all functions
- Use dataclasses for domain models
- Context managers for resource cleanup

#### File Locations
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_{module}.py`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_{workflow}.py`
- Performance tests: `tests/performance/`
- Test fixtures: `tests/fixtures/`
- Test configuration: `tests/conftest.py` for pytest fixtures
- Coverage config should go in: `pytest.ini` or `.coveragerc`

#### Security Requirements
[Source: architecture/security.md]
- **SAST Tool**: Bandit for Python static analysis
- **Dependency Scanning**: pip-audit for Python dependencies
- **Security Testing Focus**: API keys, order manipulation, injection attacks
- **Logging Restrictions**: No keys, passwords, or full order details in logs

#### Existing Test Infrastructure
Based on file analysis:
- Extensive unit tests already exist in `tests/unit/` (90+ test files)
- Integration tests cover major workflows in `tests/integration/`
- Performance tests started in `tests/performance/test_latency_benchmarks.py`
- Test fixtures and conftest.py already configured
- Error simulator exists in `genesis/testing/error_simulator.py`

### Testing Requirements for This Story

1. **Coverage Configuration**:
   - Configure pytest-cov with minimum thresholds
   - Exclude non-critical paths from coverage requirements
   - Focus on 100% coverage for: risk_engine, executor, math utils

2. **Test Organization**:
   - Follow existing pattern: `test_{module}.py` for unit tests
   - Integration tests should test complete workflows
   - Performance tests should verify <50ms p99 latency

3. **Mocking Strategy**:
   - Use pytest-mock for external dependencies
   - VCR.py for recording actual API responses
   - In-memory SQLite for database tests

4. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - All tests must run in GitHub Actions
   - Performance tests should track regression
   - Security scans on every commit
