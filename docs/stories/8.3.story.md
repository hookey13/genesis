## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
[Source: 8.2.story.md#224-238]
Story 8.2 completed Python environment and dependency management with Poetry migration, multi-layer security scanning, and optimized Docker builds. Key completions include reproducible builds with poetry.lock and comprehensive vulnerability scanning framework. The development environment is now fully configured with cross-platform support.

### Existing Error Handling Architecture
[Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#1-36]
- **Error Model**: Hierarchical exceptions with specific handling per level
- **Exception Hierarchy**: BaseError → DomainError → TradingError → OrderError
- **Logging Library**: structlog 24.1.0 with JSON format
- **Log Levels**: DEBUG (dev only), INFO (normal), WARNING (degraded), ERROR (failure), CRITICAL (money at risk)
- **Required Context**: Correlation ID (UUID), Service Context (component/function/line), User Context (account_id and tier only)
- **External API Errors**:
  - Retry Policy: Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, max 30s
  - Circuit Breaker: Open after 5 failures in 30s, half-open after 60s
  - Timeouts: Connect: 5s, Read: 10s, Total: 30s
- **Business Logic Errors**: Custom exceptions like TierViolation, RiskLimitExceeded, TiltInterventionRequired
- **Error Codes**: GENESIS-XXXX format for tracking
- **Data Consistency**: All-or-nothing database operations, compensation logic for partial failures, idempotency with client order IDs

### System Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#5-114]
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Using asyncio event loops with publish-subscribe pattern via internal event bus
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Already identified as key pattern for API resilience
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data access layer for database operations
- **State Machine Pattern**: Tier-locked finite state machine controlling features
- **Command Pattern**: Encapsulated order objects with validation and rollback
- **Event Sourcing**: All state changes recorded as events for reconstruction
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Clear module boundaries for Risk, Trading, Psychology, Analytics

### File Structure and Module Organization
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#35-130]
Key locations for error handling components:
- `genesis/core/` - Domain core where exceptions.py exists (line 39)
- `genesis/core/exceptions.py` - Custom exceptions (existing file to update)
- `genesis/engine/` - Trading engine with event_bus.py (line 44)
- `genesis/exchange/circuit_breaker.py` - Circuit breaker already planned (line 87)
- `genesis/utils/decorators.py` - Location for retry decorator (line 128)
- `genesis/utils/logger.py` - Structlog configuration (line 129)
- `tests/unit/` - Unit test location (line 143)
- `tests/integration/` - Integration test location (line 148)

### Technology Stack
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#15-51]
- **Language**: Python 3.11.8 (no Python 3.12 features allowed)
- **Async Framework**: asyncio (stdlib) for concurrent I/O
- **Logging**: structlog 24.1.0 for structured JSON logging
- **Database**: SQLite 3.45.0 for MVP, PostgreSQL 16.1 for $2k+
- **Queue**: Python asyncio.Queue for MVP, Redis 7.2.4 for $2k+
- **HTTP Client**: aiohttp 3.9.3 for async HTTP
- **Testing**: pytest 8.0.0 with pytest-asyncio
- **Process Manager**: supervisor 4.2.5 for automatic recovery

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#23-33]
Critical rules for error handling:
- **NEVER catch bare exceptions**: Always catch specific exceptions
- **ALWAYS use structlog**: Never use print() or console.log
- **ALWAYS use database transactions**: For multi-step operations
- **ALWAYS validate state after restart**: Never assume in-memory state matches reality
- **Use asyncio for all I/O**: Blocking I/O freezes the event loop
- **Type hints are mandatory**: For all functions
- **Context managers for resource cleanup**: Ensures connections are closed

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#5-44]
- **Coverage Goals**: 100% for money paths, 90% for risk/tilt, 70% for UI/analytics
- **Framework**: pytest 8.0.0 with pytest-asyncio
- **Unit Tests**: 70% of tests, fast and isolated
- **Integration Tests**: 20% of tests, component interactions
- **Test Location**: `tests/unit/test_{module}.py`, `tests/integration/test_{workflow}.py`
- **Mocking**: pytest-mock with faker for test data
- **Test Infrastructure**: In-memory SQLite for speed, Python queues instead of Redis for MVP

### Implementation Details from Epic
