## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 7.2 (Exchange Connection Hardening):
- API credentials currently managed through genesis/config/settings.py using environment variables
- Exchange authentication uses HMAC SHA256 with API key/secret
- Connection security established with TLS for exchange communication
- Rate limiting and circuit breakers protect against API abuse
- No sensitive data currently logged (keys properly redacted)

### Security Architecture Patterns
[Source: architecture/security.md]

**Secrets Management Strategy:**
- Development: `.env` file with strict `.gitignore` (never committed)
- Production: HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager
- Access secrets only via configuration service
- NEVER hardcode secrets in code
- No secrets in logs or error messages

**Authentication Implementation:**
- API key with HMAC signatures (no JWT - stateless is dangerous for trading)
- Server-side sessions with Redis, 4-hour timeout
- Separate keys for read vs trade permissions
- IP whitelist enforcement at application level
- API key validation in dedicated auth.py module

**Encryption Requirements:**
[Source: architecture/security.md#Data Protection]
- SQLite database encrypted with SQLCipher
- TLS 1.3 for all external communication
- AES-256 for data at rest (backups)
- No personal data stored (account_id only)

### File Locations for Implementation
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Security module: `genesis/security/` (new directory)
  - `vault_client.py` - HashiCorp Vault integration
  - `key_rotation.py` - API key rotation orchestration
  - `permissions.py` - Role-based access control
  - `ip_whitelist.py` - IP whitelist management
  - `audit_logger.py` - Audit logging system
- Configuration updates: `genesis/config/settings.py`
- API authentication: `genesis/api/auth.py`
- Database encryption: `genesis/db/database.py`
- Security middleware: `genesis/api/security_middleware.py`
- Scripts:
  - `scripts/rotate_keys.py` - Manual key rotation
  - `scripts/generate_audit_report.py` - Audit reporting
- Documentation: `docs/security/` (new directory)

### Security Tools and Libraries
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Secrets Management**: HashiCorp Vault (production) or AWS Secrets Manager
- **Static Analysis**: Bandit for Python SAST
- **Dependency Scanning**: pip-audit for vulnerability detection
- **Database Encryption**: SQLCipher for SQLite
- **Backup Encryption**: restic 0.16.3 with AES-256
- **Logging**: structlog 24.1.0 with JSON output
- **VPN/Access**: SSH tunnel for MVP, Tailscale 1.56.1 for team ($5k+)

### Critical Security Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Input validation using Pydantic 2.5.3 with custom validators
- Validation at API boundary AND before execution (defense in depth)
- Rate limiting: 10 requests per second per endpoint
- No personal data stored, only account_id
- Quarterly security self-audits
- Security updates within 24 hours for critical issues
- New dependencies require security review

### Database Schema Updates
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
New tables required:
```sql
-- API Key Versions Table
CREATE TABLE api_key_versions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    key_identifier TEXT NOT NULL,
    version INTEGER NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    rotated_at TIMESTAMP,
    status TEXT CHECK(status IN ('active', 'rotating', 'expired')),
    UNIQUE(key_identifier, version)
);

-- User Roles Table  
CREATE TABLE user_roles (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    role TEXT CHECK(role IN ('READ_ONLY', 'TRADER', 'ADMIN')),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Permissions Table
CREATE TABLE permissions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    role TEXT NOT NULL,
    resource TEXT NOT NULL,
    action TEXT NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE(role, resource, action)
);

-- Audit Log Table (append-only)
CREATE TABLE audit_log (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    event_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    user_id TEXT,
    ip_address TEXT,
    resource TEXT,
    action TEXT,
    result TEXT CHECK(result IN ('success', 'failure')),
    metadata JSON
);
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_timestamp ON audit_log(timestamp);
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_user ON audit_log(user_id);
```

### Exchange API Security Context
[Source: architecture/external-apis.md#Binance Spot Trading API]
- Binance supports separate API keys for:
  - Read-only access (market data, account info)
  - Trading access (place/cancel orders)
  - Withdrawal access (NOT needed - disable)
- API authentication: HMAC SHA256 signature
- IP whitelist configurable in Binance account settings
- Rate limits enforced by exchange (respect them)
