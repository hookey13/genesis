### Architecture Alignment
**From Epic 10 PRD:**
- Arbitrage detection is core to Sniper tier strategies
- Must detect opportunities >0.3% profit after fees
- Triangular arbitrage for multi-hop opportunities
- Statistical arbitrage for correlated pairs
- Feed opportunities to risk engine for validation

**Exchange Fee Structures:**
- Binance: 0.1% maker/taker (0.075% with BNB)
- Coinbase: 0.5% maker/taker
- Kraken: 0.16% maker, 0.26% taker
- Must account for actual fee tiers

**Key Dependencies:**
- `numpy` for statistical calculations
- `scipy` for cointegration testing
- `networkx` for graph algorithms (add if needed)
- Reuse existing gateway for fee data

**Integration Points:**
- Market Analyzer: Provides orderbook data
- Risk Engine: Validates opportunities
- Trading Engine: Executes validated opportunities
- WebSocket Manager: Real-time price updates

### Implementation Guidelines
1. Use Decimal for all financial calculations
2. Implement thread-safe operations for concurrent detection
3. Cache exchange fee structures to avoid repeated lookups
4. Use graph algorithms for efficient path finding
5. Log all detected opportunities at INFO level
6. Include detailed opportunity metadata for analysis
7. Handle exchange downtime gracefully
8. Implement circuit breaker for bad data

### Algorithm Details
**Direct Arbitrage:**
```python
profit = (bid_exchange_a - ask_exchange_b) / ask_exchange_b
net_profit = profit - (fee_a + fee_b)
```

**Triangular Arbitrage:**
```python
# Path: EUR -> USD -> BTC -> EUR
# Check if product of rates > 1 after fees
rate_product = rate_1 * rate_2 * rate_3
fee_product = (1 - fee_1) * (1 - fee_2) * (1 - fee_3)
net_return = rate_product * fee_product
profit = net_return - 1
```

**Statistical Arbitrage:**
```python
# Calculate z-score of spread
z_score = (current_spread - mean_spread) / std_spread
# Entry when |z_score| > 2, exit when returns to mean
```

### Configuration Parameters
Default configuration:
- `min_profit_pct`: 0.3 (minimum profit percentage)
- `min_confidence`: 0.6 (minimum confidence score)
- `max_path_length`: 4 (max hops for triangular)
- `stat_arb_window`: 100 (lookback for statistics)
- `opportunity_ttl`: 5 (seconds before expiry)
- `max_opportunities`: 50 (cap for performance)
