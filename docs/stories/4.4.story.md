## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 4.3 (TWAP Execution):
- Successfully implemented tier gating using `@requires_tier` decorator pattern
- Event bus integration working well with Priority.HIGH for execution events
- State machine patterns established for complex workflows
- Database migration patterns proven with Alembic
- UI widget integration patterns established in dashboard

### Data Models
**Account Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md lines 8-16]
- tier: Enum[SNIPER|HUNTER|STRATEGIST|ARCHITECT] - Current tier (locked by state machine)
- tier_started_at: DateTime - When entered current tier
- gates_passed: JSON - Array of passed gate requirements
- locked_features: JSON - Features disabled at current tier

**Event Model for Audit Trail** [Source: architecture/data-models.md lines 150-162]
- event_type: String - "TierProgression", "TierDemotion", "GateCompleted"
- aggregate_id: UUID - Account ID for tier changes
- event_data: JSON - Full transition context including gates, reason, timestamp
- sequence_number: BigInt - Global ordering for replay

**Tier Progression Gates** [Source: PRD Epic 4]
- SNIPER → HUNTER ($2k threshold): Requires minimum balance, win rate, behavioral baseline
- HUNTER → STRATEGIST ($10k threshold): Additional gates for risk management, multi-pair success
- Emergency demotion triggers: Rapid losses, severe tilt, multiple risk violations

### Component Specifications
**Tier State Machine** [Source: architecture/components.md lines 17-28]
- `check_tier_requirement(required: Tier) -> bool` - Gate check for features
- `evaluate_progression() -> TierTransition` - Check if gates passed for upgrade
- `force_demotion(reason: str) -> None` - Emergency tier downgrade
- `get_available_features() -> List[str]` - What's unlocked at current tier
- Dependencies: Account repository, Event Bus
- Technology: Python state machine with decorators, persistent state in SQLite

**Event Bus Integration** [Source: architecture/components.md lines 5-15]
- Publish tier transition events with Priority.HIGH
- Event types needed: TIER_PROGRESSION, TIER_DEMOTION, GATE_COMPLETED
- Subscribe to account balance changes for automatic gate checking
- Store all transitions in immutable event log

**Tilt Detector Integration** [Source: architecture/components.md lines 43-54]
- Monitor for Valley of Death indicators during transition period
- Increased sensitivity during first 48 hours in new tier
- Automatic intervention if behavioral anomalies detected
- Integration with grace period system

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- State machine enhancement: `genesis/engine/state_machine.py` (existing)
- Tier readiness assessor: `genesis/tilt/tier_readiness_assessor.py` (new)
- Transition checklist: `genesis/tilt/transition_checklist.py` (new)
- Valley monitor: `genesis/tilt/valley_of_death_monitor.py` (new)
- UI widgets: `genesis/ui/widgets/tier_gate_progress.py` (new)
- Database migration: `alembic/versions/009_add_tier_transition_tables.py` (new)
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_tier_readiness.py`, etc. (new)
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_tier_transition_workflow.py` (new)

### Technical Constraints
**Coding Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- NEVER modify tier without state machine - all changes must go through validation
- Use Decimal for all monetary gate thresholds
- Use `@requires_tier` decorator pattern for feature gating
- Database transactions required for multi-step state changes
- Proper event sourcing for complete audit trail

**Critical Implementation Rules**:
- NO manual tier modifications allowed - enforce through database constraints
- Grace period timer must persist through restarts
- All tier transitions must be reversible (except manual overrides)
- Feature unlocks must be atomic with tier transition
- Tutorial content must be tier-specific and stored in config

### Configuration Requirements
**tier_gates.yaml** - COMPLETED - Configuration file created at `config/tier_gates.yaml` with the following structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md line 28]:
```yaml
tiers:
  HUNTER:
    min_balance: 2000
    required_win_rate: 0.45
    min_trades: 100
    behavioral_baseline_days: 7
    features_unlocked:
      - iceberg_orders
      - multi_pair_trading
  STRATEGIST:
    min_balance: 10000
    required_win_rate: 0.55
    min_trades: 500
    multi_pair_success_rate: 0.60
    features_unlocked:
      - twap_execution
      - statistical_arbitrage
```

### UI/UX Considerations
**Dashboard Integration**:
- Gate progress bars showing real-time completion status
- Ceremony animation triggering on successful transition
- Tutorial modal for each newly unlocked feature
- Historical transition timeline view
- Emergency warnings for demotion risk

**Valley of Death Monitoring**:
- First 48 hours in new tier marked as "adjustment period"
- Increased behavioral monitoring sensitivity
- Proactive coaching messages
- Reduced position size limits during grace period

### Risk Management Rules
**Demotion Triggers** (must monitor continuously):
- Balance falls below tier minimum for >1 hour
- Three consecutive stop losses hit
- Tilt score >80 during active trading
- Risk limit violations (3 strikes in 24 hours)
- Manual override by emergency intervention

**Rollback Protection**:
- Database constraint preventing direct tier column updates
- All tier modifications must have event log entry
- Audit log must show state machine validation
- No API endpoints for manual tier changes

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- Framework: pytest 8.0.0 with pytest-asyncio
- Coverage requirement: 100% for state machine modifications
- Mock tier transitions with various gate combinations
- Test all demotion trigger scenarios
- Verify grace period persistence through restart

**Critical Test Scenarios**:
- Automatic progression when all gates passed
- Automatic demotion on trigger conditions
- Grace period countdown and expiry
- Feature unlock atomicity
- Rollback protection enforcement
- Tutorial generation for each tier
- Ceremony display timing
- Event log completeness
- Recovery from interrupted transitions
- Multi-tier progression in single session
- Emergency intervention during transition
- Valley of Death detection accuracy

### Review Date: 2025-08-26

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates exceptional quality in tier transition management with robust safety mechanisms. The system successfully prevents premature tier transitions through comprehensive psychological and technical readiness assessments. Key architectural strengths include:

- **Database Design**: Well-structured migration with proper foreign keys, indexes, and a trigger preventing manual tier changes
- **State Machine Pattern**: Excellent use of decorators (@prevent_manual_tier_change) and proper transaction management
- **Valley of Death Protection**: Critical 48-hour monitoring period after transitions with emergency intervention capabilities
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Proper event publishing for all tier transitions with high priority handling

### Critical Issues Found

**Type Annotation Incompatibility**: Tests cannot execute due to Python version incompatibility
- Multiple files use `Session | None` syntax requiring Python 3.10+
- Should use `Optional[Session]` or `Union[Session, None]` for broader compatibility

**Missing Enum Definitions**: Test/implementation mismatch
- Tests expect `ChecklistCategory` and `ChecklistStatus` enums not present in implementation
- ChecklistItem class missing status property that tests reference

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✗ Type hints incompatible with project Python version
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows established patterns perfectly
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Tests cannot execute due to import errors
- All ACs Met: ✓ Implementation covers all 8 acceptance criteria

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Fix type annotations to use `Optional[Session]` instead of `Session | None`
