### Key Implementation Notes
- Use FastHttpUser from locust.contrib.fasthttp for better performance
- Implement JWT authentication in on_start() method for each user class
- Use catch_response=True to validate response content and timing
- Monitor memory usage with psutil during 48-hour stability tests
- Leverage existing auth infrastructure from Story 9.1 (JWT/bcrypt)
- Database connection pooling from Story 9.2 must handle load
- Test against Vault integration from Story 9.3 for secret retrieval

## Testing Standards

### Test Framework Configuration
- **Framework:** Locust 2.17 with distributed worker support
- **Test Location:** tests/load/ directory for all load testing files
- **Performance Tests:** tests/performance/ for benchmark suites
- **Execution:** Docker Compose for distributed test execution
- **CI/CD Integration:** GitHub Actions workflow in .github/workflows/performance-test.yml

### Testing Patterns
```python
# Standard test user pattern
class BaseTestUser(FastHttpUser):
    abstract = True

    def on_start(self):
        """Authenticate and setup user session."""
        self.login()
        self.setup_test_data()

    def login(self):
        """Standard JWT authentication flow."""
        response = self.client.post("/auth/login", json={
            "username": self.get_test_username(),
            "password": self.get_test_password()
        })
        if response.status_code == 200:
            self.token = response.json()['access_token']
            self.headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {self.token}'}
```

### Performance Baselines
- Order placement: <50ms p99 response time
- Position retrieval: <10ms p99 response time
- Authentication: <100ms p99 response time
- WebSocket message latency: <10ms p99
- Database queries: <5ms p99 under load

### Load Test Data Requirements
- Pre-create 10,000 test user accounts with bcrypt passwords
- Generate realistic trading symbols and order data
- Prepare market data snapshots for WebSocket testing
- Create database with 1M+ historical orders for volume testing
