# Story 1.6: Trade Logging & Persistence

## Status
Done

## Story

2. Every trade logged with entry/exit/P&L/timestamps
3. Position recovery on restart from database
4. Daily backup to separate file
5. Trade export to CSV for tax purposes
6. Performance metrics calculation (win rate, average R)
7. Database size management (rotation after 10MB)
8. Audit trail for all system decisions

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.5 completion:
- Terminal UI established with command system ready for database queries
- UI can display P&L and position data that will come from this persistence layer
- Command system can integrate export commands (e.g., 'export csv 2024')
- Status messages can show backup confirmations
- Integration layer (`genesis/ui/integration.py`) ready to connect to repository

From Story 1.4 completion:
- OrderExecutor publishes OrderExecuted events that need persistence
- All financial values use Decimal type (must serialize as strings in database)
- Position model tracks entry_price, current_price, quantity, pnl calculations

From Story 1.3 completion:
- AccountManager tracks balance and needs persistence for recovery
- Position sizing calculations depend on account state
- Daily loss limits need historical trade data

    UNIQUE(aggregate_id, sequence_number)
);
CREATE INDEX idx_events_aggregate ON events(aggregate_id, sequence_number);
CREATE INDEX idx_events_type_time ON events(event_type, created_at);
```

### Repository Pattern Implementation

**Abstract Repository Interface** [Source: architecture/components.md#Data Repository Layer]:
```python
class Repository(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def save(self, entity: Any) -> None:
        """Persist entity to storage"""
    
    @abstractmethod  
    def find_by_id(self, entity_type: Type, entity_id: str) -> Optional[Any]:
        """Retrieve entity by ID"""
    
    @abstractmethod
    def query(self, criteria: Dict) -> List[Any]:
        """Query entities by criteria"""
    
    @abstractmethod
    def backup(self) -> None:
        """Create backup of database"""
```

### Technical Constraints

**Critical Rules** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Critical Rules]:
- ALWAYS use Decimal for money, NEVER float
- ALWAYS use database transactions for multi-step operations  
- ALWAYS validate state after restart - Never assume in-memory state matches reality
- All financial values stored as strings in database (Decimal serialization)

**Performance Requirements**:
- Database queries must not block trading operations
- Use indexes for all foreign keys and query patterns
- Backup process must not interrupt trading
- CSV export should handle 10,000+ trades efficiently

### Testing Requirements

From [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]:
- **Coverage target**: 90%+ for repository layer (money path)
- **Framework**: pytest 8.0.0 with pytest-asyncio
- **Test database**: In-memory SQLite for unit tests
- **Integration tests**: Full database with test fixtures
- **Key test scenarios**:
  - Position recovery after crash
  - Database rotation at 10MB
  - Backup and restore integrity
  - CSV export accuracy
  - Transaction rollback on errors

## Testing
- Unit test files: `tests/unit/test_repository.py`, `tests/unit/test_sqlite_repo.py`
- Integration test files: `tests/integration/test_order_flow.py`, `tests/integration/test_risk_flow.py`
- Use in-memory SQLite for fast unit tests
- Use temporary file database for integration tests
- Mock datetime for backup scheduler tests
- Test data builders in `tests/fixtures/`
- Coverage target: 90%+ for repository layer (money path)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-24

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates excellent understanding of database persistence patterns with comprehensive event sourcing, backup systems, and recovery mechanisms. The repository pattern is well-implemented with proper abstraction layers. Overall quality score: **8.5/10**

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: genesis/data/models_db.py:134
  - **Change**: Changed `win_rate` column from Float to String
  - **Why**: Financial precision requirement - all monetary values must be stored as strings for Decimal precision
  - **How**: Ensures consistent precision handling across all financial metrics

- **File**: genesis/data/sqlite_repo.py:185, 191
  - **Change**: Fixed order type and status constraints to match model definitions
  - **Why**: Schema mismatch between SQLite table creation and SQLAlchemy models
  - **How**: Aligned constraints with OrderDB model (STOP_LIMIT vs STOP_LOSS, added PARTIALLY_FILLED and REJECTED statuses)

- **File**: genesis/data/sqlite_repo.py (multiple locations)
  - **Change**: Standardized all datetime operations to use UTC
  - **Why**: Inconsistent timezone handling could cause data integrity issues
  - **How**: Replaced all `datetime.now()` with `datetime.utcnow()` for consistent UTC timestamps

- **File**: genesis/data/sqlite_repo.py:37-41
  - **Change**: Added custom JSON encoder for Decimal serialization
  - **Why**: json.dumps() cannot serialize Decimal objects directly
  - **How**: Created `decimal_default()` function and applied to all json.dumps calls

- **File**: tests/unit/test_sqlite_repo.py:272-280
  - **Change**: Fixed test data to use correct enum values and required fields
  - **Why**: Position creation was failing due to incorrect enum values and missing required fields
  - **How**: Changed side from "long" to "LONG" and added required dollar_value field

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Excellent adherence to Python best practices and project conventions
- Project Structure: ✓ Clean separation of concerns with repository pattern
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive test coverage with unit and integration tests
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 8 acceptance criteria successfully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed win_rate column type for precision (genesis/data/models_db.py)
- [x] Aligned order constraints between schema and models (genesis/data/sqlite_repo.py)
- [x] Standardized datetime to UTC throughout (genesis/data/sqlite_repo.py)
- [x] Added Decimal JSON serialization support (genesis/data/sqlite_repo.py)
- [x] Fixed test data for proper enum values (tests/unit/test_sqlite_repo.py)
- [ ] Consider implementing connection pooling for high-concurrency scenarios
- [ ] Add retry logic for transient database errors
- [ ] Implement query result caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Extract complex calculations into separate service classes
- [ ] Document transaction rollback limitations with aiosqlite

### Security Review

No significant security concerns found:
- ✓ SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- ✓ No hardcoded credentials
- ✓ Proper foreign key constraints
- ✓ Transaction isolation implemented

### Performance Considerations

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive indexing strategy on all foreign keys and query patterns
- WAL mode enabled for better concurrency
- Database rotation prevents unbounded growth
- Efficient query patterns with proper WHERE clauses

**Areas for optimization:**
- Position reconciliation loads all open positions into memory (line 1090-1120)
- Performance metrics calculation could benefit from aggregation queries (line 1302-1387)
- Consider bulk operations for large data sets
