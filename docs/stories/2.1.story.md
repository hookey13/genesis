### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.6 completion:
- SQLite database configured with WAL mode for better concurrency
- Event store provides immutable audit trail for all events
- Repository pattern established for data persistence
- Decimal type used for all financial values (stored as strings in DB)

### Market Data Models
**MarketState Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#MarketState]:
```python
- state_id: UUID
- symbol: String
- state: Enum[DEAD|NORMAL|VOLATILE|PANIC|MAINTENANCE]
- volatility_atr: Decimal
- spread_basis_points: Integer
- volume_24h: Decimal
- liquidity_score: Decimal
- detected_at: DateTime
- state_duration_seconds: Integer
```

**Event Model for Audit Trail** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Event]:
```python
- event_id: UUID
- event_type: String (e.g., "MarketDataUpdated", "SpreadAlert")
- aggregate_id: UUID
- event_data: JSON

```

### WebSocket Configuration
**Binance WebSocket Streams** [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#Binance WebSocket Streams API]:
- Base URL: wss://stream.binance.com:9443/ws
- Combined streams: wss://stream.binance.com:9443/stream
- Rate limits: 5 connections per IP, 24 hour connection limit
- Key streams:
  - `/ws/<symbol>@trade` - Real-time trades
  - `/ws/<symbol>@depth20@100ms` - Order book (20 levels, 100ms)
  - `/ws/<symbol>@kline_1m` - 1-minute candles
  - `/ws/<symbol>@ticker` - 24hr rolling ticker

**Connection Resilience** [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#Integration Notes]:
- Heartbeat/pong every 30 seconds to keep alive
- Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff
- Buffer missed messages during reconnection
- Maintain 3 connections: execution, monitoring, backup
- Use REST API catchup for gaps

### Exchange Gateway Integration
**Key Interfaces** [Source: architecture/components.md#Exchange Gateway]:

- subscribe_market_data(symbol: str) -> AsyncIterator[Tick]
- get_balance() -> Balance
- Circuit breaker pattern for failure protection
```

### Market Data Service Component
**Responsibility** [Source: architecture/components.md#Market Data Service]:
Real-time price feeds, order book management, and market state classification

**Key Interfaces**:

### Technical Constraints
**Critical Rules** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Critical Rules]:
- ALWAYS use Decimal for money, NEVER float
- ALWAYS use asyncio for all I/O operations
- NEVER catch bare exceptions - catch specific exceptions
- Type hints are mandatory for all functions
- Use structlog for all logging (no print statements)

**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Python 3.11.8 with asyncio (native async support)
- websockets 12.0 for WebSocket client (pure Python, asyncio native)
- pandas 2.2.0 for statistical calculations
- numpy 1.26.3 for array operations
- aiohttp 3.9.3 for async HTTP (REST API catchup)
- ccxt 4.2.25 for Binance API abstraction (rate limit handling)
- structlog 24.1.0 for structured logging

### Database Schema Updates
**market_states Table** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#Phase 1]:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS market_states (
    state_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    symbol TEXT NOT NULL,
    state TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (state IN ('DEAD', 'NORMAL', 'VOLATILE', 'PANIC', 'MAINTENANCE')),
    volatility_atr TEXT,  -- Decimal as string
    spread_basis_points INTEGER,
    volume_24h TEXT,      -- Decimal as string
    liquidity_score TEXT, -- Decimal as string
    detected_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    state_duration_seconds INTEGER
);
CREATE INDEX idx_market_states_symbol ON market_states(symbol, detected_at);
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-25

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates excellent software engineering practices with an overall quality score of **8.7/10**. The market data service is exceptionally well-designed with proper Decimal usage for financial calculations, comprehensive error handling, and a solid event-driven architecture. The WebSocket manager correctly implements all required features including 60s max reconnection, gap detection, and REST API catchup. However, there are some issues that need attention before production deployment.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed as the code quality is generally high. The issues identified are better addressed by the development team due to their nature (test fixtures, deprecation updates).

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Excellent adherence - Decimal for money, asyncio for I/O, specific exception handling, type hints throughout
- Project Structure: ✓ Files correctly organized per architecture/source-tree.md
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Unit tests comprehensive, integration tests designed but blocked by fixture issues
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 8 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] Fix integration test async fixtures (`tests/integration/test_market_streams.py:55`)
- [ ] Update WebSocket imports to remove deprecation warnings (`genesis/exchange/websocket_manager.py:18`)
- [ ] Implement gap detection cleanup mechanism to prevent memory leaks
- [ ] Complete SQLite volume persistence (marked incomplete in tasks)
- [ ] Add VCR.py for API response recording
- [ ] Update Pydantic Field usage to `json_schema_extra` syntax

### Security Review

**PASS** - Proper authentication headers, secure WebSocket connections, no credential leakage detected. All API keys properly managed through environment variables.

### Performance Considerations

**CONCERNS** - Memory management needs improvement for long-running processes. The `detected_gaps` list in WebSocket manager grows unbounded. Circular buffer correctly limits to 1000 candles as required. Recommend implementing periodic cleanup tasks.

### Files Modified During Review

No files were modified during this review.

### Gate Status

Gate: **CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/2.1-real-time-market-data-ingestion.yml

Key findings:
- Integration test failures blocking end-to-end validation
- Deprecation warnings affecting future compatibility
- Memory management concerns with unbounded collections

### Recommended Status

✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items above

The implementation is fundamentally sound with excellent core functionality. Address the integration test fixtures and memory management concerns before marking as Done. The deprecation warnings should be resolved for future maintainability.
