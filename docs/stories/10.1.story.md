# Story 10.1: Market Analysis Engine & Arbitrage Detection

**Epic:** Epic 10 - Core Trading Brain Implementation
**Type:** Parallel-Safe (Can be split)
**Branch:** feature/10-1
**Estimated Hours:** 16
**Developer Assignment:** Lead Developer

## User Story
As a trading system architect,
I want to implement the core market analysis engine with arbitrage opportunity detection,
So that the system can identify and rank profitable trading opportunities in real-time across multiple pairs and exchanges.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Real-time order book analysis with depth aggregation
2. Cross-exchange arbitrage opportunity detection (>0.3% profit threshold)
3. Triangular arbitrage calculation for multi-hop opportunities
4. Spread analysis with historical baseline comparison
5. Liquidity depth assessment for position sizing
6. Market microstructure anomaly detection
7. Opportunity ranking by risk-adjusted profit potential
8. Latency-optimized calculations (<10ms per pair)
9. Statistical significance testing for opportunities
10. Integration with existing WebSocket market data streams
