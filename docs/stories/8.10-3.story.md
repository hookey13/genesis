__all__ = [
    'SecretsScanner',
    'VulnerabilityScanner',
    'ComplianceValidator',
    'EncryptionValidator',
    'SecurityConfigValidator'
]
```

### Secret Detection Patterns
[Source: architecture/security.md - Secrets Management]

```python
# genesis/validation/security/secrets_scanner.py
import re
from pathlib import Path
from typing import List, Dict

class SecretsScanner(Validator):
    """Scans for hardcoded secrets in codebase"""

    SECRET_PATTERNS = {
        'api_key': r'(?i)(api[_\-]?key|apikey)["\']?\s*[:=]\s*["\']([A-Za-z0-9+/]{20,})["\']',
        'aws_key': r'(?i)(aws[_\-]?access[_\-]?key[_\-]?id|aws[_\-]?secret[_\-]?access[_\-]?key)',
        'private_key': r'-----BEGIN (RSA|DSA|EC|OPENSSH) PRIVATE KEY-----',
        'password': r'(?i)(password|passwd|pwd)["\']?\s*[:=]\s*["\']([^"\']+)["\']',
        'token': r'(?i)(auth[_\-]?token|access[_\-]?token|bearer)["\']?\s*[:=]\s*["\']([A-Za-z0-9+/=]{20,})["\']',
        'binance_key': r'(?i)(binance[_\-]?api[_\-]?key)["\']?\s*[:=]\s*["\']([A-Za-z0-9]{64})["\']',
        'binance_secret': r'(?i)(binance[_\-]?api[_\-]?secret)["\']?\s*[:=]\s*["\']([A-Za-z0-9]{64})["\']'
    }

    ALLOWED_PATTERNS = {
        'env_var': r'os\.getenv\(["\']([A-Z_]+)["\']\)',
        'config_ref': r'config\.(get|settings)\.([A-Z_]+)',
        'vault_ref': r'vault\.get_secret\(["\']([^"\']+)["\']\)'
    }

    async def run_validation(self, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> ValidationResult:
        violations = []
        for file_path in Path('genesis').rglob('*.py'):
            violations.extend(await self._scan_file(file_path))

        # Also scan with gitleaks for git history
        git_violations = await self._run_gitleaks()
        violations.extend(git_violations)

        if violations:
            return ValidationResult(
                check_id='SEC-001',
                status=CheckStatus.FAILED,
                message=f'Found {len(violations)} potential secrets',
                evidence={'violations': violations},
                metadata={'files_scanned': len(list(Path('genesis').rglob('*.py')))}
            )
```

### Vulnerability Scanning
[Source: architecture/security.md - Dependency Security]

```python
# genesis/validation/security/vulnerability_scanner.py
class VulnerabilityScanner(Validator):
    """Scans dependencies for known vulnerabilities"""

    SEVERITY_THRESHOLDS = {
        'critical': 0,  # No critical vulnerabilities allowed
        'high': 3,      # Max 3 high severity
        'medium': 10,   # Max 10 medium severity
        'low': None     # No limit on low severity
    }

    async def run_validation(self, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> ValidationResult:
        # Run Safety for Python dependencies
        safety_results = await self._run_safety_check()

        # Run Trivy for Docker images
        docker_results = await self._run_trivy_scan()

        # Run OWASP dependency check
        owasp_results = await self._run_owasp_check()

        # Aggregate and evaluate against thresholds
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-02

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates strong security-focused design with comprehensive coverage of all 10 acceptance criteria. All five security validators have been implemented with proper async patterns and extensive validation logic. The code quality is high with good separation of concerns and clear module structure.

### Refactoring Performed

Critical architectural improvements were made to ensure proper integration with the validation framework:

- **File**: genesis/validation/security/secrets_scanner.py
  - **Change**: Refactored to inherit from base Validator class
  - **Why**: The class did not inherit from the required base Validator class in genesis/validation/base.py
  - **How**: Added proper inheritance, implemented run_validation method, maintained backward compatibility with legacy validate method

- **File**: genesis/validation/security/vulnerability_scanner.py
  - **Change**: Refactored to inherit from base Validator class
  - **Why**: Missing inheritance from framework base class
  - **How**: Added Validator inheritance with proper validator_id and metadata

- **File**: genesis/validation/security/compliance_validator.py
  - **Change**: Refactored to inherit from base Validator class
  - **Why**: Framework integration requirement
  - **How**: Proper inheritance with SOC 2 compliance validator configuration

- **File**: genesis/validation/security/encryption_validator.py
  - **Change**: Refactored to inherit from base Validator class
  - **Why**: Consistent framework integration
  - **How**: Added inheritance and validation framework integration

- **File**: genesis/validation/security/config_validator.py
  - **Change**: Refactored to inherit from base Validator class
  - **Why**: Complete framework consistency
  - **How**: Integrated with validation framework, marked as non-critical

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ All validators now follow proper inheritance patterns, use async/await, include type hints
- Project Structure: ✓ Properly organized in genesis/validation/security/ subdirectory
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit tests (34 passing), integration tests present
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 10 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Refactored all security validators to inherit from base Validator class
- [x] Added proper validator IDs (SEC-001 through SEC-005)
- [x] Implemented run_validation methods for framework compatibility
- [x] Maintained backward compatibility with legacy validate methods
- [x] Added proper imports for ValidationContext, ValidationResult, etc.
- [ ] Consider adding more detailed remediation guidance in violation messages
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks for large repository scanning
- [ ] Consider implementing parallel scanning for improved performance
- [ ] Add configuration file for customizing security thresholds

### Security Review

**Critical Finding**: The validators correctly implement comprehensive security scanning including:
- Hardcoded secret detection with multiple pattern types
- Environment variable usage validation
- Git history scanning with gitleaks integration
- Vulnerability scanning with Safety, pip-audit, Bandit, and Trivy
- SOC 2 Type II compliance validation with all five trust principles
- Encryption validation for data at rest and in transit
- Security configuration validation for headers, rate limiting, and authentication

No security vulnerabilities were introduced. The refactoring maintains all security functionality while improving framework integration.

### Performance Considerations

- Async implementation allows for concurrent validation execution
- External tool checks (gitleaks, safety, trivy) may add latency
- Consider caching vulnerability database updates between runs
- File scanning could benefit from parallel processing for large codebases

### Files Modified During Review

- genesis/validation/security/secrets_scanner.py
- genesis/validation/security/vulnerability_scanner.py
- genesis/validation/security/compliance_validator.py
- genesis/validation/security/encryption_validator.py

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/8.10-3-security-compliance-validators.yml
Risk Level: HIGH (security-critical functionality)
Quality Score: 85/100

### Recommended Status

[✓ Ready for Done] - All acceptance criteria met, critical architectural issues resolved through refactoring, comprehensive test coverage confirmed. Minor improvements are non-blocking suggestions for future enhancement.
