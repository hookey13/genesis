**WebSocket Monitoring (for real-time emergency detection):**
- `/ws/<symbol>@trade` - Real-time trades for flash crash detection
- `/ws/<symbol>@depth20@100ms` - Order book for liquidity monitoring
- Maintain separate emergency monitoring connection
- Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff on disconnect
[Source: architecture/external-apis.md#Binance WebSocket Streams API]

### Technical Constraints
