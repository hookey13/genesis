- All components follow async patterns for non-blocking operations

### Logging Framework
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology_Stack_Table, genesis/utils/logger.py]
- **Framework**: structlog 24.1.0 with JSON output
- **Existing Implementation**: Complete logging setup in `genesis/utils/logger.py`
- **Log Locations**:
  - Trading: `.genesis/logs/trading.log`
  - Audit: `.genesis/logs/audit.log` (tamper-proof with checksums)

  - System: `.genesis/logs/system.log`
- **Current Rotation**: 10MB max file size, 5 backup files
- **Compression**: Built-in gzip compression for rotated logs
- **Configuration**: `config/settings.py` - LoggingSettings class

### Database Configuration
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md, architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Phase 1**: SQLite 3.45.0 with WAL mode
- **Phase 2**: PostgreSQL 16.1 (future migration)
- **SQLite Optimizations Required**:
  ```sql
  PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;
  PRAGMA synchronous = NORMAL;
  PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;
  ```
- **Migration Tool**: Alembic 1.13.1 in `/alembic/` directory
- **Indexes**: Critical indexes on positions, orders, events, correlations tables
- **Vacuum**: Required for SQLite space reclamation

### Configuration Management
[Source: config/settings.py]
- **Framework**: Pydantic-based Settings class
- **Environment Variables**: Full .env support with validation
- **Relevant Settings Classes**:
  - `BackupSettings`: For S3/Spaces integration
  - `PerformanceSettings`: For performance tuning
  - `LoggingSettings`: For log rotation configuration
- **Schedule Format**: Cron expressions for automated tasks

### Performance Monitoring
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, docker/prometheus/prometheus.yml]
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus 2.48.1 + Grafana 10.3.1
- **Metrics Endpoint**: Application metrics exposed for Prometheus
- **Existing**: `genesis/monitoring/` directory with metrics exporters
- **Performance Logger**: Context manager for timing operations
- **Requirements**: <100ms execution path, 99.5% uptime

### Correlation and Strategy Components
[Source: genesis/strategy/correlation_tracker.py, genesis/strategy/position_manager.py]
- **Correlation Tracker**: Existing implementation in `genesis/strategy/correlation_tracker.py`
- **Strategy Parameters**: Configuration in `config/trading_rules.yaml`
- **Position Management**: Strategy execution in `genesis/strategy/position_manager.py`
- **Hot Reload Pattern**: Use signal handlers for configuration updates

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Framework**: pytest 8.0.0 with pytest-asyncio
- **Coverage Target**: 90% for operational components
- **Test Locations**:
  - Unit: `tests/unit/test_{component}.py`
  - Integration: `tests/integration/test_{workflow}.py`
- **Patterns**: Use fixtures for database and configuration setup

### Security Considerations
[Source: Story 7.3 context]
- Certificate management must integrate with future TLS requirements
- Dependency updates must include security scanning
- All operational actions must be logged to audit trail
- Sensitive operations require elevated permissions

### Integration Points
- **Backup System** (Story 7.5): Reuse S3/Spaces client for log archival
- **Monitoring** (Story 7.4): Export all operational metrics to Prometheus
- **Docker/CI** (Story 7.1): Operational scripts must work in containerized environment
- **Security** (Story 7.3): Certificate management for TLS encryption

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

**Test File Locations:**
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_log_archiver.py`, `test_db_optimizer.py`, `test_cert_manager.py`, etc.
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_operational_workflows.py`
- Performance tests: `tests/performance/test_optimization_impact.py`

### Test Design Recommendations

```gherkin
# Critical Test Scenarios

Feature: Health Monitor Self-Healing
  Scenario: Database connection pool exhaustion
    Given connection pool is at 95% capacity
    When health check detects exhaustion
    Then connections should be reset
    And trading should not be interrupted

  Scenario: Memory leak detection and remediation
    Given memory usage exceeds 85% threshold
    When health monitor triggers remediation
    Then controlled restart should occur
    And state should be preserved

Feature: Strategy A/B Testing
  Scenario: Statistical significance validation
    Given two parameter sets with 100+ trades each
    When evaluating test results
    Then p-value should be calculated correctly
    And underperforming parameters should rollback

Feature: Correlation Matrix Hot Reload
  Scenario: Update without position disruption
    Given active trading positions
    When correlation matrix is updated
    Then positions should remain consistent
    And no orders should be lost
```
