- `genesis/strategies/strategist/inventory_manager.py` - Inventory risk management
- `genesis/execution/spread_model.py` - Dynamic spread calculation
- `genesis/execution/quote_generator.py` - Quote generation logic
- `tests/unit/test_market_maker.py` - Unit tests for market maker
- `tests/integration/test_market_making.py` - Integration tests

**Module Ownership:**
- **Primary Ownership:** `genesis/strategies/strategist/market_maker.py`
- **Secondary Ownership:** `genesis/strategies/strategist/inventory_manager.py`
- **Tertiary Ownership:** `genesis/execution/spread_model.py`
- **No Touch Modules:** `vwap_execution.py` (owned by Developer 1), Hunter tier strategies

#### Implementation Details from Epic

Based on Epic 10 requirements, the market making strategy must:

1. **Inherit from BaseStrategy:** Use `genesis.strategies.base.BaseStrategy` as the parent class
2. **Use existing models:** Import from `genesis.core.models` (Order, Signal, etc.)
3. **Integrate with risk engine:** All orders validated through `genesis.risk.risk_engine`
4. **Support Strategist tier:** This is a $10k+ capital strategy for professional market making

#### Code Structure Requirements

```python
# Import structure based on architecture
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional, Tuple
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from decimal import Decimal
from dataclasses import dataclass

from genesis.strategies.base import BaseStrategy
from genesis.core.models import Order, OrderType, Signal, SignalType
from genesis.analytics.market_analyzer import MarketAnalyzer

import structlog
logger = structlog.get_logger()
```

#### Spread Model Algorithm

The SpreadModel should calculate spreads based on:
- **Base spread:** Minimum profitable spread considering fees
- **Volatility adjustment:** Widen spreads in volatile conditions
- **Inventory adjustment:** Skew spreads based on position
- **Competition adjustment:** Tighten spreads to stay competitive
- **Adverse selection:** Widen spreads when detecting toxic flow

Formula: `spread = base_spread * volatility_multiplier * inventory_skew * competition_factor`

#### Inventory Management Rules

1. **Maximum Position:** 10% of total capital per symbol
2. **Inventory Zones:**
   - Green (0-30%): Normal operation
   - Yellow (30-70%): Reduce position building
   - Red (70-100%): Position reduction only
3. **Skew Calculation:** `skew = current_inventory / max_inventory`
4. **Price Adjustment:** 
   - Long inventory: Lower bids, raise asks
   - Short inventory: Raise bids, lower asks

#### Quote Generation Parameters

- **Quote Layers:** Up to 3 layers of quotes on each side
- **Layer Spacing:** Exponentially increasing (1x, 2x, 4x base spread)
- **Size Distribution:** 40%, 35%, 25% of total quote size
- **Refresh Frequency:** Every 5 seconds or on 0.1% price move
- **Minimum Quote Size:** Exchange minimum or $100 equivalent

#### Adverse Selection Detection

1. **Toxic Flow Indicators:**
   - One-sided fills (>80% on one side)
   - Immediate losses after fills
   - High correlation with aggressive market moves
2. **Response Actions:**
   - Widen spreads by 2x
   - Reduce quote sizes by 50%
   - Increase refresh frequency
3. **Recovery:** Gradually normalize after 100 clean fills

#### Risk Management Parameters

- **Maximum Drawdown:** 2% of capital
- **Daily Loss Limit:** 1% of capital
- **Position Limits:** Hard stop at max inventory
- **Correlation Limits:** Max 0.5 correlation between positions
- **Fee Consideration:** Only quote if expected profit > fees

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] Fix test failures in TestMarketMakingStrategy class (setup_method async issue)
- [ ] Fix toxic flow detection threshold calculation (15/20 = 75% not triggering at 80%)
- [ ] Fix order acceptance test assertion (position limit calculation)
- [ ] Add integration tests for P&L tracking and performance validation
- [ ] Add monitoring metrics for spread efficiency analysis
- [ ] Consider implementing circuit breakers for extreme market conditions
- [ ] Add configuration validation to prevent invalid parameter combinations

### Security Review

No critical security issues found. Implementation properly validates inputs, enforces position limits, and includes appropriate risk controls. Consider adding:
- Rate limiting protection against rapid quote updates
- Audit logging for all position changes and risk limit breaches
- Encrypted storage for strategy parameters

### Performance Considerations

- Quote generation is efficient with O(n) complexity for n layers
- Inventory tracking uses dictionaries for O(1) lookups
- Spread calculation performs multiple factor calculations but remains performant
- Consider caching spread calculations when market conditions stable
- Monitor memory usage with large position histories

### Non-Functional Requirements Assessment

**Security:** PASS - Position limits enforced, input validation present
**Performance:** PASS - Sub-millisecond quote generation, efficient data structures
**Reliability:** CONCERNS - Some test failures indicate edge cases not fully handled
**Maintainability:** PASS - Clear separation of concerns, well-structured code

### Risk Assessment

**Medium Risk Areas:**
1. Test failures in strategy integration tests (setup issues)
2. Toxic flow detection threshold calculation error
3. Missing end-to-end P&L validation

**Low Risk Areas:**
1. Missing circuit breakers for extreme volatility
2. No explicit configuration validation
3. Limited observability/monitoring hooks

### Files Modified During Review

None - code quality acceptable as-is, test fixes should be addressed by developer

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/10.4.2-market-making-strategy.yml
Risk profile: Medium - Test failures need resolution
