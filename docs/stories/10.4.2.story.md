#### File Locations and Ownership

**Files to Create:**
- `genesis/strategies/strategist/market_maker.py` - Main market making strategy
- `genesis/strategies/strategist/inventory_manager.py` - Inventory risk management
- `genesis/execution/spread_model.py` - Dynamic spread calculation
- `genesis/execution/quote_generator.py` - Quote generation logic
- `tests/unit/test_market_maker.py` - Unit tests for market maker
- `tests/integration/test_market_making.py` - Integration tests

**Module Ownership:**
- **Primary Ownership:** `genesis/strategies/strategist/market_maker.py`
- **Secondary Ownership:** `genesis/strategies/strategist/inventory_manager.py`
- **Tertiary Ownership:** `genesis/execution/spread_model.py`
- **No Touch Modules:** `vwap_execution.py` (owned by Developer 1), Hunter tier strategies

#### Implementation Details from Epic

Based on Epic 10 requirements, the market making strategy must:

1. **Inherit from BaseStrategy:** Use `genesis.strategies.base.BaseStrategy` as the parent class
2. **Use existing models:** Import from `genesis.core.models` (Order, Signal, etc.)
3. **Integrate with risk engine:** All orders validated through `genesis.risk.risk_engine`
4. **Support Strategist tier:** This is a $10k+ capital strategy for professional market making

#### Code Structure Requirements

```python
# Import structure based on architecture
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional, Tuple
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from decimal import Decimal
from dataclasses import dataclass

from genesis.strategies.base import BaseStrategy
from genesis.core.models import Order, OrderType, Signal, SignalType
from genesis.analytics.market_analyzer import MarketAnalyzer

import structlog
logger = structlog.get_logger()
```

#### Spread Model Algorithm

The SpreadModel should calculate spreads based on:
- **Base spread:** Minimum profitable spread considering fees
- **Volatility adjustment:** Widen spreads in volatile conditions
- **Inventory adjustment:** Skew spreads based on position
- **Competition adjustment:** Tighten spreads to stay competitive
- **Adverse selection:** Widen spreads when detecting toxic flow

Formula: `spread = base_spread * volatility_multiplier * inventory_skew * competition_factor`

#### Inventory Management Rules

1. **Maximum Position:** 10% of total capital per symbol
2. **Inventory Zones:**
   - Green (0-30%): Normal operation
   - Yellow (30-70%): Reduce position building
   - Red (70-100%): Position reduction only
3. **Skew Calculation:** `skew = current_inventory / max_inventory`
4. **Price Adjustment:** 
   - Long inventory: Lower bids, raise asks
   - Short inventory: Raise bids, lower asks

#### Quote Generation Parameters

- **Quote Layers:** Up to 3 layers of quotes on each side
- **Layer Spacing:** Exponentially increasing (1x, 2x, 4x base spread)
- **Size Distribution:** 40%, 35%, 25% of total quote size
- **Refresh Frequency:** Every 5 seconds or on 0.1% price move
- **Minimum Quote Size:** Exchange minimum or $100 equivalent

#### Adverse Selection Detection

1. **Toxic Flow Indicators:**
   - One-sided fills (>80% on one side)
   - Immediate losses after fills
   - High correlation with aggressive market moves
2. **Response Actions:**
   - Widen spreads by 2x
   - Reduce quote sizes by 50%
   - Increase refresh frequency
3. **Recovery:** Gradually normalize after 100 clean fills

#### Risk Management Parameters

- **Maximum Drawdown:** 2% of capital
- **Daily Loss Limit:** 1% of capital
- **Position Limits:** Hard stop at max inventory
- **Correlation Limits:** Max 0.5 correlation between positions
- **Fee Consideration:** Only quote if expected profit > fees

### Testing Standards

From `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`:
- Test files location: `tests/unit/` and `tests/integration/`
- Test file naming: `test_*.py`
- Testing framework: pytest
- Coverage requirement: >85% for new code
- Mock exchanges using `tests/mocks/mock_exchange.py`
- Use fixtures for common test data
- Test both profitable and unprofitable scenarios
- Include adverse market conditions

### Integration Points

1. **Market Data:** Real-time bid/ask via `genesis.exchange.gateway`
2. **Risk Engine:** Quote validation through `genesis.risk.risk_engine`
3. **Order Management:** Submit quotes via `genesis.engine.executor`
4. **Performance Tracking:** Report P&L to `genesis.analytics.metrics`
5. **State Management:** Persist inventory via `genesis.data.repository`

## Validation and Testing Instructions

### Pre-Implementation Validation

2. Confirm minimum order sizes for target pairs
3. Validate API rate limits for quote updates

### Unit Testing Requirements
- Test spread calculation under various conditions
- Test inventory skew adjustments
- Test quote generation with multiple layers
- Test adverse selection detection accuracy
- Test position limit enforcement
- Mock all market data and execution

### Integration Testing Requirements
- Simulate two-sided market making for 1000 ticks
- Verify inventory stays within limits
- Test P&L under various market conditions
- Validate quote refresh logic
- Test emergency position reduction

### Performance Validation
- Generate 100 quotes per second

## Security Considerations

1. **Quote Validation:** Verify all quotes before submission
2. **Inventory Protection:** Never exceed position limits
3. **Rate Limiting:** Respect exchange rate limits
4. **Error Isolation:** Isolate errors per trading pair
5. **State Encryption:** Protect strategy parameters
