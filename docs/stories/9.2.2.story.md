# Sub-Story 9.2.2: Connection Pooling & Table Partitioning

## Status
Done

## Story Information
**Epic:** 9 - Critical Security & Infrastructure Hardening
**Parent Story:** 9.2 - PostgreSQL Migration & Database Infrastructure
**Sub-Story ID:** 9.2.2
**Priority:** High (P1)
**Estimated Effort:** 4 hours
**Dependencies:** 9.2.1 (PostgreSQL Migration)

## Story
**As a** database architect,
**I want** optimized connection pooling and table partitioning,
**So that** the system can efficiently handle high-frequency trading loads.

## Problem Statement
Without proper connection pooling and table partitioning, PostgreSQL cannot efficiently handle the concurrent connections and large time-series datasets required for production trading operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. PgBouncer connection pooling in transaction mode
2. Optimized pool sizing for trading workload
3. Time-based partitioning for orders and trades tables
4. Automated partition management and pruning
5. Query optimization for partitioned tables
6. Connection pool monitoring and alerting
7. Partition pruning effectiveness validation
8. Performance benchmarks meeting <5ms query targets

## Technical Implementation

### Connection Pool Configuration
```ini
# pgbouncer.ini
[databases]
genesis_trading = host=postgres port=5432 dbname=genesis_trading

[pgbouncer]
listen_port = 6432
listen_addr = *
auth_type = md5
auth_file = /etc/pgbouncer/userlist.txt

# Connection limits
max_client_conn = 1000
default_pool_size = 50
min_pool_size = 10
reserve_pool_size = 10

# Pool mode for trading workload
pool_mode = transaction
server_reset_query = DISCARD ALL

# Timeouts optimized for trading
server_connect_timeout = 15
server_login_retry = 2
query_timeout = 30
query_wait_timeout = 120
client_login_timeout = 60
```

### Partitioning Strategy
```sql
-- Create partitioned orders table
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id BIGSERIAL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    symbol VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    side VARCHAR(4) NOT NULL CHECK (side IN ('buy', 'sell')),
    type VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    quantity DECIMAL(20, 8) NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(20, 8),
    status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    exchange_order_id VARCHAR(100),
    metadata JSONB,
    PRIMARY KEY (id, created_at)
) PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);

-- Automated partition creation function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION create_monthly_partition(table_name text, start_date date)
RETURNS void AS $$
DECLARE
    partition_name text;
    end_date date;
BEGIN
    partition_name := table_name || '_' || to_char(start_date, 'YYYY_MM');
    end_date := start_date + interval '1 month';

    EXECUTE format('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS %I PARTITION OF %I
                    FOR VALUES FROM (%L) TO (%L)',
                   partition_name, table_name, start_date, end_date);

    -- Create indexes on partition
    EXECUTE format('CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS %I ON %I (symbol, created_at DESC)',
                   'idx_' || partition_name || '_symbol_time', partition_name);

    EXECUTE format('CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS %I ON %I (status) WHERE status = %L',
                   'idx_' || partition_name || '_pending', partition_name, 'pending');
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

## Dev Notes

### Project Structure
The Genesis trading system uses the following database structure:
```
genesis/
├── database/
│   ├── postgres_manager.py    # Main PostgreSQL connection manager
│   ├── partition_manager.py   # NEW: Automated partition management
│   ├── pool_monitor.py        # NEW: Connection pool monitoring
│   └── migration_engine.py    # Existing migration utilities
├── config/
│   ├── database.py            # Database configuration
│   └── pgbouncer.ini         # NEW: PgBouncer configuration
└── models/
    ├── base.py               # SQLAlchemy base models
    └── trading.py            # Trading-specific models
```

### PostgreSQL Configuration Context
From parent story 9.2, the PostgreSQL setup includes:
- PostgreSQL 15+ with optimized postgresql.conf
- max_connections = 200 (at database level)
- shared_buffers = 1GB, effective_cache_size = 3GB
- WAL settings optimized for write performance
- pg_stat_statements enabled for query monitoring

### Connection Pooling Architecture
PgBouncer sits between the application and PostgreSQL:
```
Application (Port 8000) → PgBouncer (Port 6432) → PostgreSQL (Port 5432)
```

Transaction pooling mode is chosen for:
- Minimal connection overhead
- Support for prepared statements
- Compatibility with high-frequency trading patterns

### Partitioning Strategy
Monthly partitions for orders and trades tables:
- Automatic partition creation for next 3 months
- Retention of 12 months of hot data
- Archival process for data older than 12 months
- Partition-wise joins enabled for performance

### Performance Requirements
- Connection pool must handle 1000+ concurrent client connections
- Database queries must maintain <5ms p99 latency
- Partition pruning must reduce scan time by >90%
- Zero downtime during partition maintenance

### Testing Standards
From architecture docs:
- Unit tests: pytest with asyncio support
- Integration tests: Docker-based PostgreSQL + PgBouncer
- Performance tests: Locust for load testing
- Test location: tests/integration/test_database_performance.py
- Coverage requirement: >80% for database modules

### Security Considerations
- PgBouncer authentication via md5 (transitioning to scram-sha-256)
- Connection encryption with SSL/TLS
- Separate read-only user for analytics queries
- No hardcoded credentials (use environment variables)

## Testing

### Connection Pool Testing
```python
# tests/integration/test_connection_pool.py
async def test_connection_pool_limits():
    """Verify pool handles 1000+ connections"""
    connections = []
    for i in range(1000):
        conn = await get_connection()
        connections.append(conn)
    # Assert all connections successful

async def test_pool_recovery():
    """Test pool recovery after database restart"""
    # Simulate database failure
    # Verify automatic reconnection
```

### Partition Testing
```python
# tests/integration/test_partitioning.py
def test_partition_creation():
    """Verify automatic partition creation"""

def test_partition_pruning():
    """Verify query uses partition elimination"""

def test_partition_performance():
    """Verify <5ms query performance"""
```

## Change Log
| Date | Version | Description | Author |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|
| 2025-09-02 | 1.0 | Initial story creation | Sarah (PO) |
| 2025-09-02 | 1.1 | Added comprehensive Dev Notes and Tasks | Sarah (PO) |

## Notes
This optimization is critical for production performance, enabling the system to handle high-frequency trading loads efficiently while maintaining data organization and query performance.

Connection pooling reduces connection overhead from ~10ms to <0.1ms per request. Table partitioning enables linear scaling with data growth while maintaining consistent query performance.
