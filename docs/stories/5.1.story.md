### Data Models
**PositionCorrelation Model:**
```python
# From database schema - already exists
position_correlations table:
- correlation_id: TEXT PRIMARY KEY (UUID)
- position_1_id: TEXT REFERENCES positions(position_id)
- position_2_id: TEXT REFERENCES positions(position_id)  
- correlation_coefficient: DECIMAL(-1 to 1)
- calculation_window: INTEGER (minutes)
- last_calculated: TIMESTAMP
- alert_triggered: BOOLEAN
```
Note: Schema enforces position_1_id < position_2_id to prevent duplicates
Bidirectional view `position_correlations_bidirectional` available for queries
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md#position_correlations]

**Position Model:**
```python
@dataclass
class Position:
    position_id: UUID
    account_id: UUID
    symbol: str
    side: Enum[LONG|SHORT]
    entry_price: Decimal
    current_price: Decimal
    quantity: Decimal
    dollar_value: Decimal
    pnl_dollars: Decimal
    pnl_percent: Decimal
    opened_at: DateTime
    closed_at: DateTime | None
```
