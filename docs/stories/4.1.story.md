## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 3.5 (Valley of Death Transition Guard):
- Tier transition system is fully implemented with state machine enforcement
- Hunter tier ($2k-$5k) features are gated and require explicit tier progression
- Paper trading enforcement ensures new execution methods are practiced before live trading
- State machine located at `genesis/engine/state_machine.py` manages all tier transitions
- All tier changes MUST go through the state machine - never modify tier directly [Source: Story 3.5 Dev Notes]

### Data Models
**Order Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- order_id: UUID - Unique identifier
- slice_number: Integer - Which slice (1 of N) for iceberg orders
- total_slices: Integer - Total slices for this execution
- slippage_percent: Decimal - Difference from expected price
- latency_ms: Integer - Execution latency
- status: Enum[PENDING|PARTIAL|FILLED|CANCELLED|FAILED]

**Position Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- position_id: UUID - Unique identifier
- dollar_value: Decimal - Position value in USDT
- pnl_dollars: Decimal - Unrealized P&L in dollars
- close_reason: String - Including 'tilt_intervention' and 'emergency'

### Database Schema

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS orders (
    order_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    position_id TEXT REFERENCES positions(position_id),
    client_order_id TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,  -- Idempotency key
    slice_number INTEGER,
    total_slices INTEGER,
    slippage_percent DECIMAL(10,4),
    status TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (status IN ('PENDING', 'PARTIAL', 'FILLED', 'CANCELLED', 'FAILED'))
);
```

### Component Specifications
**Order Executor Component** [Source: architecture/components.md]
- Located in `genesis/engine/executor/`
- Key Interfaces:
  - `execute_iceberg_order(order: Order, slices: int) -> ExecutionResult` - Sliced execution
  - `cancel_all_orders() -> None` - Emergency stop
- Dependencies: Exchange Gateway, Risk Engine, Tier State Machine
- Technology: Python asyncio, ccxt for exchange interaction

**Risk Engine Component** [Source: architecture/components.md]
- `calculate_position_size(balance: Decimal, risk_percent: Decimal) -> Decimal`
- `check_risk_limits(position: Position) -> RiskDecision`
- Must validate all iceberg orders before execution

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- Executor implementation: `genesis/engine/executor/iceberg.py`
- Analytics components: `genesis/analytics/`
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_iceberg_executor.py`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_iceberg_workflow.py`
- Database migration: `alembic/versions/006_add_iceberg_order_tables.py`

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Python 3.11.8 exclusively - no Python 3.12 features
- Decimal from decimal module for all money calculations (NEVER use float)
- asyncio for all I/O operations
- ccxt 4.2.25 for Binance API interaction
- structlog 24.1.0 for structured logging

**Coding Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Classes: PascalCase (e.g., `IcebergOrderExecutor`)
- Functions: snake_case (e.g., `calculate_slice_sizes`)
- Money variables: Suffix with currency (e.g., `order_value_usdt`)
- Time variables: Suffix with unit (e.g., `delay_seconds`)
- ALWAYS use idempotency keys (client_order_id) for every order
- ALWAYS use database transactions for multi-step operations
- NEVER modify tier without state machine

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- Framework: pytest 8.0.0 with pytest-asyncio
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_{module}.py`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_{workflow}.py`
- Coverage requirement: 100% for executor code (money path)
- Database testing: In-memory SQLite for speed
- Mocking: pytest-mock with faker for test data

**Critical Test Scenarios:**
- Order exactly at $200 boundary (should trigger slicing)
- Order at $199.99 (should not trigger slicing)
- Order book with insufficient liquidity
- Slippage exceeding 0.5% threshold
- Network failure during slice execution
- Partial fill with rollback request
- Concurrent iceberg orders
- Tier gate enforcement (Sniper tier should be rejected)

**Test File Locations:**
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_iceberg_executor.py`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_iceberg_workflow.py`
- Migration tests: `tests/unit/test_migration_006.py`

**Testing Patterns:**
- Use `pytest.mark.asyncio` for async test methods
- Use `@pytest.fixture` for test data builders
- Mock Exchange Gateway responses with VCR.py
- Assert using pytest assertions, not unittest

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-26

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The Iceberg Order Execution implementation demonstrates sophisticated financial engineering with strong adherence to coding standards and proper use of async patterns. The architecture is clean with good separation of concerns across execution, analysis, monitoring, and reporting components. All monetary calculations correctly use Decimal type avoiding floating-point issues. Tier gating is properly enforced requiring Hunter tier. However, critical security and testing gaps prevent immediate production deployment.

**Overall Quality Score: 70/100** (1 high severity, 2 medium severity, 1 low severity issues)

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed during this review as the implementation files show good code quality. The main issues are missing components and security gaps rather than code quality problems.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ PascalCase classes, snake_case functions, proper money/time suffixes
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows source tree organization correctly
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Missing unit tests for report generator, no integration tests
- All ACs Met: ✗ AC7 (reporting tests missing), AC8 (manual confirmation missing)

### Improvements Checklist

Security & Critical Issues:
- [ ] Add manual confirmation requirement to rollback_partial_execution method (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Create tests/unit/test_iceberg_report_generator.py with full coverage
- [ ] Add tests/integration/test_iceberg_workflow.py for end-to-end testing
- [ ] Complete base executor integration (Story lines 76-81 marked incomplete)

Code Quality Enhancements:
- [ ] Refactor execute_iceberg_order method (currently 213 lines - should be <50)
- [ ] Extract magic numbers to configuration (lines 40-46 in iceberg.py)
- [ ] Add circuit breaker pattern to prevent runaway executions
- [ ] Implement concurrent execution limits to prevent position limit violations

Performance & Monitoring:
- [ ] Randomize order book cache TTL to prevent timing attacks
- [ ] Add performance metrics tracking for execution times
- [ ] Implement real-time alerting for failed executions
- [ ] Enhanced execution state logging for debugging

### Security Review

**CRITICAL FINDING**: The rollback_partial_execution method at line 666-741 in iceberg.py lacks manual confirmation requirement. This allows unauthorized order reversals which could be exploited for market manipulation or accidental loss. The method executes compensating orders without any authorization check.

**Recommended Fix**:
```python
async def rollback_partial_execution(self, execution_id: str, confirmed_by: str = None):
    if not confirmed_by:
        raise ValidationError("Manual confirmation required for rollbacks")
    # ... rest of implementation
```

Additional security considerations:
- Order book cache TTL (5 seconds) is predictable and could be exploited
- No protection against multiple concurrent iceberg orders exceeding position limits
- Consider adding rate limiting on iceberg execution requests

### Performance Considerations

The implementation shows good performance awareness with order book caching (5-second TTL) and efficient liquidity analysis. However:
- Sequential slice execution could be parallelized for urgent orders
- Market impact calculation waits synchronously which could delay time-sensitive executions  
- Recovery monitoring ties up resources for 5 minutes per execution

### Files Modified During Review

No files were modified during this review. All findings are recommendations for the development team.

### Gate Status

Gate: **CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/4.1-iceberg-order-execution.yml
Risk profile: Not generated (integrated into gate decision)
NFR assessment: Integrated into gate decision

The implementation is functionally strong but requires immediate attention to security vulnerability in rollback authorization and completion of test coverage before production deployment.

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items above**

Priority fixes required:
1. Add manual confirmation to rollback operation (security critical)
2. Create missing test file for report generator
3. Add integration tests for complete workflow
4. Complete base executor integration tasks

Once these issues are addressed, the story can move to Done status.
