# Story 9.5: Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity

## Story Information
**Epic:** 9 - Critical Security & Infrastructure Hardening  
**Story ID:** 9.5  
**Priority:** High (P1)  
**Estimated Effort:** 8 hours  
**Dependencies:** Stories 9.2 (PostgreSQL), 9.3 (Vault), 9.4 (Performance baselines)  
**Sub-Stories:** 9.5.1, 9.5.2  

## User Story
As a reliability engineer,  
I want comprehensive disaster recovery with automated failover,  
So that the system can recover from any failure within 5 minutes with zero data loss.

## Problem Statement
The current system has no disaster recovery plan, backup strategy, or failover mechanisms. Any hardware failure, data corruption, or regional outage would result in complete system loss and potential total loss of trading capital. For a system managing $100k+ in assets, comprehensive disaster recovery with automated failover, cross-region replication, and zero-data-loss recovery is absolutely mandatory. The system must be able to survive and recover from any conceivable failure scenario.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Automated database backups every 15 minutes
2. Point-in-time recovery to any second in last 7 days
3. Cross-region backup replication
4. Automated failover with <5 minute RTO (Recovery Time Objective)
5. Zero data loss (RPO = 0) for committed transactions
6. Disaster recovery drills automated monthly
7. Backup integrity verification daily
8. Configuration backup and version control
9. Runbook automation for common failures
10. Post-incident analysis automation

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Backup Health Monitoring

backup_success_rate = Gauge(
    'genesis_backup_success_rate',
    'Backup success rate over time window'
)

backup_duration = Histogram(
    'genesis_backup_duration_seconds',
    'Time taken to complete backups',
    ['backup_type']
)

recovery_time_objective = Gauge(
    'genesis_rto_seconds',
    'Current recovery time objective measurement'
)

recovery_point_objective = Gauge(
    'genesis_rpo_seconds', 
    'Current recovery point objective measurement'
)
```

### Alert Conditions
- Backup failure for any component
- Cross-region replication lag >5 minutes
- Backup integrity verification failure
- DR drill failure or performance degradation
- Storage capacity approaching limits
- Network connectivity issues between regions

## Notes
This is a **CRITICAL RELIABILITY** story that ensures business continuity for a trading system handling significant capital. Without proper disaster recovery, any failure could result in complete loss of trading capital and business operations.

The implementation must cover all failure scenarios:
- **Hardware failures** - server, storage, network equipment
- **Software failures** - database corruption, application crashes
- **Infrastructure failures** - data center outages, cloud provider issues
- **Human errors** - accidental deletions, misconfigurations
- **Security incidents** - breaches requiring system rollback
- **Natural disasters** - requiring cross-region failover

Key principles:
- **Automation over manual procedures** - reduces recovery time and human error
- **Multiple backup strategies** - different methods reduce single points of failure
- **Regular testing** - ensures procedures work when needed
- **Cross-region redundancy** - protects against regional disasters
- **Zero-downtime design** - minimizes service interruption

The system must be designed to survive any conceivable failure and recover quickly with minimal or no data loss. This is not optional for a production trading system.
