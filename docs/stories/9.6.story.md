# Story 9.6: Production Monitoring & Observability

## Story Information
**Epic:** 9 - Critical Security & Infrastructure Hardening  
**Story ID:** 9.6  
**Priority:** High (P1)  
**Estimated Effort:** 8 hours  
**Dependencies:** Stories 9.1-9.5 (Complete infrastructure for monitoring)  
**Sub-Stories:** 9.6.1, 9.6.2, 9.6.3  

## User Story
As a site reliability engineer,  
I want comprehensive monitoring with full observability,  
So that we can detect and resolve issues before they impact trading.

## Problem Statement
The current system has minimal monitoring and no observability framework. Without comprehensive metrics, distributed tracing, centralized logging, and proactive alerting, operating a production trading system would be like flying blind. Critical issues could go undetected until they cause trading losses or system failures. For a system managing $100k+ in capital, enterprise-grade monitoring with full observability is essential for maintaining system reliability, performance, and availability.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Prometheus metrics for all critical operations
2. Grafana dashboards with drill-down capability
3. Distributed tracing with Jaeger/Zipkin
4. Centralized logging with ELK stack
5. Real-time alerting with PagerDuty integration
6. SLI/SLO tracking with error budgets
7. Custom metrics for trading performance
8. Anomaly detection with machine learning
9. Capacity planning projections
10. Executive dashboard with KPIs

## Notes
This is a **CRITICAL OBSERVABILITY** story that provides the eyes and ears needed to operate a production trading system safely. Without comprehensive monitoring, the system would be operating blind, with no ability to detect issues before they cause significant problems.

The monitoring system must provide:
- **Proactive alerting** - detecting issues before they impact trading
- **Root cause analysis** - quickly identifying the source of problems
- **Performance optimization** - identifying bottlenecks and inefficiencies
- **Capacity planning** - predicting resource needs and scaling requirements
- **Compliance reporting** - providing audit trails and SLA compliance data

Key monitoring principles:
- **Signal over noise** - focus on actionable metrics
- **Context preservation** - maintain trace correlation across services
- **Automated response** - where possible, automate common recovery procedures
- **Human-friendly** - dashboards and alerts designed for quick understanding

This comprehensive monitoring framework is essential for maintaining the reliability, performance, and profitability of the trading system in production.
