## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.4 completion:
- OrderExecutor established with market order execution capability
- Order confirmation system with 10-second timeout implemented
- Emergency cancel-all-orders function available
- Event Bus publishes OrderExecuted events (HIGH priority)
- Account balance tracked in AccountManager with 60-second sync
- Position model includes current position details and P&L tracking
- All financial values use Decimal type (never float)

### Terminal UI Framework
**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack Table]:
- **Rich 13.7.0**: For "Beautiful TUI for 'Digital Zen Garden' aesthetic"
- **Textual 0.47.1**: For "Interactive TUI framework with event-driven UI, reactive updates without flicker"
- **Python 3.11.8**: Exclusively

### Component Specifications
**Terminal UI Controller** [Source: architecture/components.md#Terminal UI Controller]:
- Responsibility: User interface, command processing, and feedback display
- Key Interfaces:
  - `render_dashboard() -> None` - Update terminal display
  - `process_command(cmd: str) -> CommandResult` - Parse and execute user input
  - `show_intervention(message: str, level: TiltLevel) -> None` - Display tilt warnings
  - `update_tier_progress() -> None` - Show gate completion status
- Dependencies: All other components (UI is the integration point)
- Technology: Rich for rendering, Textual for interaction, asyncio for real-time updates

### UI Design Requirements
**Layout Specifications** [Source: PRD sources]:
- Three-panel layout with fixed positions for muscle memory
- P&L always at top for immediate visibility
- Active positions in center for focus
- Command input at bottom for easy access
- Information stays where expected, reducing stress-induced confusion

**Color Psychology** [Source: PRD sources]:
- Green for profit (positive reinforcement)
- Gray for loss (neutral, non-triggering)
- NEVER use red (prevents emotional triggers)
- Subtle background tints for market state
- Calm, muted color palette throughout

**Update Mechanics** [Source: PRD sources]:
- 100ms update throttling prevents overwhelming rapid changes
- Numbers fade in/out rather than jumping
- Creates perception of market flow rather than chaos
- Status messages auto-fade after 3 seconds

### Command Processing
**Command-First Architecture** [Source: PRD sources]:
- Primary interaction through typed commands
- Muscle-memory shortcuts (e.g., 'b100u' = buy $100 USDT)
- Visual feedback confirms intent before execution
- Commands processed through OrderExecutor

### Data Models
The UI needs to display information from these models:
- **Account**: Current balance, daily P&L, tier status
- **Position**: Symbol, side, quantity, entry_price, current_price, unrealized_pnl, stop_loss
- **Order**: Status, fill price, execution time

### Technical Constraints
**Performance Requirements**:
- UI updates must not block trading operations
- 100ms update cycle must be consistent
- Terminal resize must not crash application
- Command processing must be <50ms

**Tier-Adaptive Complexity** [Source: PRD sources]:
- Sniper tier: Show 3 data points max (simplified view)
- This story implements Sniper tier only
- Future stories will add complexity for higher tiers

### Testing Requirements
From [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]:
- **Coverage target**: 70% for UI/analytics modules
- Framework: pytest 8.0.0
- UI testing may use mock components
- Focus on command parsing accuracy
- Test responsive layout behavior

## Testing
- Unit test file: `tests/unit/test_ui.py`
- Test dashboard layout with different terminal sizes
- Test command parser with valid/invalid inputs
- Test widget updates with mock data
- Test keyboard shortcuts trigger correct actions
- Test status message timing and fade
- Mock all external component dependencies
- Use pytest-asyncio for async UI tests
- Coverage target: 70% for UI module

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-24

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The Terminal UI implementation demonstrates strong architectural design with proper separation of concerns and excellent adherence to requirements. The Textual/Rich framework usage is correct and the three-panel layout is well-implemented. However, there are 9 failing tests that need immediate attention, and test coverage is significantly below target (21% vs 70%).

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring performed during this review. The existing code structure is sound, but test failures must be resolved before making structural changes.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Clean code with proper async patterns
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows architecture/source-tree.md specifications
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Coverage at 21% vs 70% target, 9 tests failing
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 8 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] Fix 9 failing tests in tests/unit/test_ui.py
- [ ] Fix stop_loss type annotation in genesis/ui/widgets/positions.py (should be Optional[Decimal])
- [ ] Increase test coverage from 21% to 70% target
- [ ] Complete integration layer connections to actual components (currently using mocks)
- [ ] Add error handling for edge cases in update loops
- [ ] Implement proper confirmation dialog for quit action (Ctrl+Q)

### Security Review

No security vulnerabilities identified. Command input validation is properly implemented. The UI layer correctly sanitizes user input before passing to core components.

### Performance Considerations

- ✓ 100ms update cycle properly implemented with async patterns
- ✓ No blocking operations in UI thread
- ✓ Reactive properties ensure flicker-free updates
- ✓ Terminal resize handling is non-blocking

### Files Modified During Review

None - Test failures need to be resolved before any refactoring.
