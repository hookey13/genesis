## Dev Notes

### Existing Infrastructure
The project already has a basic backup infrastructure that needs enhancement:

**Current Files:**
- `genesis/backup/backup_manager.py` - Basic SQLite backup manager with S3 support
- `genesis/backup/s3_client.py` - S3 client for backup storage
- `genesis/utils/disaster_recovery.py` - DR utilities framework
- `genesis/validation/operational/backup_validator.py` - Backup validation logic

**PostgreSQL Migration Context (from Story 9.2):**
- PostgreSQL 15+ will be used with connection pooling via PgBouncer
- WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) archiving must be configured for PITR
- Database will use custom format dumps for parallel restore capability
- Connection details will be stored in Vault (from Story 9.3)

**Vault Integration (from Story 9.3):**
- All backup encryption keys must be stored in Vault
- Vault snapshots need special handling for seal keys
- Use transit engine for envelope encryption of sensitive backups

### Configuration Requirements
```python
# config/backup_config.py
BACKUP_CONFIG = {
    'postgres': {
        'backup_interval_minutes': 15,
        'wal_archive_command': 'aws s3 cp %p s3://genesis-wal/%f',
        'backup_format': 'custom',  # For parallel restore
        'compression_level': 9
    },
    's3': {
        'primary_bucket': 'genesis-backups-primary',
        'regions': ['us-east-1', 'us-west-2'],
        'encryption': 'AES256',
        'storage_class': 'STANDARD_IA',
        'lifecycle_days': 7
    },
    'monitoring': {
        'metrics_port': 9090,
        'alert_webhook': 'https://events.pagerduty.com/v2/enqueue',
        'health_check_interval': 60
    }
}
```

### Integration Points
1. **PostgreSQL**: Use asyncpg for database connections (from Story 9.2)
2. **Vault**: Use hvac client for secret operations (from Story 9.3)
3. **S3**: Extend existing S3Client with boto3 for cross-region
4. **Monitoring**: Integrate with Prometheus metrics (from Story 9.6)

## Testing

### Testing Standards
Based on the project's testing framework:
- **Test Location**: `tests/integration/test_backup_system.py`
- **Framework**: pytest with pytest-asyncio for async tests
- **Mocking**: Use unittest.mock for external services
- **Coverage**: Minimum 90% code coverage required

### Test Implementation
```python
# tests/integration/test_backup_system.py
import pytest
import asyncio
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch
from genesis.backup.backup_manager import BackupManager

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_automated_backup_schedule():
    """Test backup runs every 15 minutes."""
    # Test implementation

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_cross_region_replication():
    """Test backup replicates across regions."""
    # Test implementation

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_backup_integrity_verification():
    """Test backup integrity checks."""
    # Test implementation

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_point_in_time_recovery():
    """Test PITR to specific timestamp."""
    # Test implementation
```

### Performance Testing
```python
# tests/performance/test_backup_performance.py
async def test_backup_completion_time():
    """Verify backup completes in <5 minutes."""
    # Test implementation

async def test_recovery_time_objective():
    """Verify recovery achieves <15 minute RTO."""
    # Test implementation
```

## Security Considerations
1. **Encryption**: All backups must be encrypted with AES-256
2. **Key Management**: Encryption keys stored in Vault, never in code
3. **Access Control**: S3 buckets with strict IAM policies
4. **Audit Logging**: All backup operations logged for compliance
5. **Network Security**: TLS for all data transfers
6. **Credential Rotation**: Database credentials rotated via Vault

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-02

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The automated backup system implementation demonstrates excellent architecture and comprehensive coverage of all requirements. The implementation successfully addresses all 8 acceptance criteria with proper PostgreSQL support, cross-region replication, encryption, compression, and monitoring. The code is well-structured with proper separation of concerns across multiple specialized managers.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: genesis/backup/backup_manager.py
  - **Change**: Fixed `_determine_retention_policy` method to properly calculate backup_interval_hours
  - **Why**: Method referenced undefined variable `self.backup_interval_hours`
  - **How**: Now correctly calculates hours from `self.backup_interval_minutes / 60`

- **File**: genesis/backup/backup_manager.py
  - **Change**: Made `_calculate_sha256_checksum` truly async using executor
  - **Why**: Method was blocking despite being async
  - **How**: Now uses `loop.run_in_executor` for non-blocking I/O operations

- **File**: config/backup_config.py
  - **Change**: Created missing configuration file as specified in story
  - **Why**: Configuration file was referenced but not implemented
  - **How**: Added comprehensive backup configuration with all required settings

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows PEP 8, proper type hints, consistent naming
- Project Structure: ✓ Well-organized module structure with clear separation
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit, integration, and performance tests
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 8 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Requirements Traceability

**AC-1 (15-minute backups)**: ✓ Implemented in BackupManager.__init__ with backup_interval_minutes=15
**AC-2 (Cross-region replication)**: ✓ S3Client supports multi-region with parallel uploads
**AC-3 (Integrity verification)**: ✓ SHA256 checksums and verify_backup_integrity method
**AC-4 (Point-in-time recovery)**: ✓ WAL archiving and get_backup_for_timestamp method
**AC-5 (Config/secret backups)**: ✓ Separate managers for vault, config, and state backups
**AC-6 (Retention policies)**: ✓ Comprehensive retention with hourly/daily/monthly/yearly
**AC-7 (Monitoring/alerting)**: ✓ Prometheus metrics and PagerDuty integration
**AC-8 (Recovery validation)**: ✓ RecoveryManager with test_recovery_procedure

### Test Coverage Analysis

- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive coverage of all backup managers
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end backup/recovery cycles tested
- **Performance Tests**: RTO/RPO validation, memory usage, concurrent operations
- **Edge Cases**: WAL handling, encryption failures, retention policies

### Security Review

✓ AES-256 encryption implemented for all backups
✓ Vault integration for key management
✓ Seal key backup with RSA-4096 encryption
✓ No hardcoded credentials or secrets
✓ Proper error handling without information leakage

### Performance Considerations

✓ Parallel uploads to multiple regions implemented
✓ Async/await patterns properly used throughout
✓ Chunked file processing to minimize memory usage
✓ Compression level 9 for maximum space efficiency
✓ Performance tests validate <5 minute backup and <15 minute RTO

### Non-Functional Requirements Assessment

- **Reliability**: PASS - Retry decorators, error handling, graceful degradation
- **Scalability**: PASS - Async operations, parallel uploads, chunked processing
- **Maintainability**: PASS - Clean architecture, good separation of concerns
- **Observability**: PASS - Comprehensive logging and Prometheus metrics

### Technical Debt Identified

None identified - implementation is clean and follows best practices

### Improvements Checklist
