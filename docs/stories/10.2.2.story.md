```

### Technical Context from Architecture

#### BaseStrategy Interface
From `genesis/strategies/base.py`:
```python
class BaseStrategy(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def analyze(self, market_data: Dict) -> Optional[Signal]:
        """Generate trading signals from market data."""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    async def manage_positions(self) -> List[Signal]:
        """Generate exit signals for existing positions."""
        pass
```

#### Signal Model Requirements
```python
@dataclass
class Signal:
    type: SignalType  # BUY, SELL, CLOSE
    symbol: str
    price: Decimal
    quantity: Decimal
    confidence: float  # 0.0 to 1.0
    strategy_name: str
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]  # Include stop_loss, take_profit
```

#### Technical Indicator Formulas

**Simple Moving Average (SMA):**
`SMA = sum(prices[-n:]) / n`

**Exponential Moving Average (EMA):**
`EMA = price * multiplier + EMA_prev * (1 - multiplier)`
`multiplier = 2 / (period + 1)`

**Average Directional Index (ADX):**
- Calculate +DI and -DI (directional indicators)
- Calculate DX = abs(+DI - -DI) / (+DI + -DI) * 100
- ADX = EMA of DX over 14 periods
- Strong trend when ADX > 25

**Average True Range (ATR):**
`TR = max(high - low, abs(high - close_prev), abs(low - close_prev))`
`ATR = SMA of TR over 14 periods`

#### Breakout Detection Algorithm
1. Track 20-period price history
2. Calculate resistance = max(highs[-20:])
3. Calculate support = min(lows[-20:])
4. Breakout UP if: current_price > resistance * 1.02
5. Breakout DOWN if: current_price < support * 0.98
6. Confirm with volume > avg_volume * 1.5
7. Validate trend with ADX > 25

#### False Breakout Filter
- Wait for 3 consecutive candles above/below breakout level
- Check that volume remains elevated
- Verify trend continuation with ADX

#### Dynamic Stop Loss Placement
- For LONG: stop = previous_swing_low - ATR * 0.5
- For SHORT: stop = previous_swing_high + ATR * 0.5
- Swing = local min/max over 5 periods

#### Trailing Profit Mechanism
- Initial stop at entry stop loss
- If profit > 0.5%, trail stop to entry + 0.1%
- Continue trailing at 0.5% distance from high water mark
- Never move stop lower (for longs) or higher (for shorts)

### Testing Standards and Requirements

#### Test Framework Configuration
- **Framework:** pytest 8.0.0 with pytest-asyncio
- **Location:** `tests/unit/test_momentum_breakout.py`
- **Coverage Target:** >85% for strategy code, 100% for indicators
- **Mock Library:** pytest-mock for market data mocking

#### Required Test Cases

1. **Breakout Detection Tests**
   - Upward breakout with 2% threshold
   - Downward breakout detection
   - No breakout in ranging market
   - Edge case: exactly at threshold

2. **Volume Confirmation Tests**
   - High volume confirms breakout
   - Low volume rejects signal
   - Volume spike detection
   - Average volume calculation

3. **Trend Validation Tests**
   - Strong trend (ADX > 25) passes
   - Weak trend (ADX < 25) fails
   - Trend direction matches breakout

4. **Risk Management Tests**
   - Stop loss placement accuracy
   - Trailing profit activation
   - Trail distance maintenance
   - Stop never moves adversely

5. **False Breakout Tests**
   - 3-candle confirmation required
   - Rejection on failed confirmation
   - Volume consistency check

#### Test Data Fixtures
```python
@pytest.fixture
def trending_market_data():
    """Generate trending market with breakout."""
    return {
        'prices': [100, 101, 102, 103, 105, 107],  # Uptrend
        'volumes': [1000, 1200, 1500, 1800, 2000, 2200],
        'highs': [101, 102, 103, 104, 106, 108],
        'lows': [99, 100, 101, 102, 104, 106],
        'timestamp': datetime.utcnow()
    }

@pytest.fixture
def ranging_market_data():
    """Generate sideways market data."""
    return {
        'prices': [100, 99, 101, 98, 100, 99],  # Range
        'volumes': [1000, 900, 1100, 950, 1000, 1050],
        'timestamp': datetime.utcnow()
    }
```

#### Performance Benchmarks
- Breakout detection: <50ms per analysis
- Indicator calculation: <10ms per indicator
- Total analyze() execution: <100ms
- Memory usage: <5MB per strategy instance

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-03

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Re-Review Date: 2025-09-03 (Post-Fixes)

### Re-Review Summary

**EXCELLENT WORK!** The developer has successfully addressed ALL critical issues identified in the initial review. The implementation is now production-ready.

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates solid understanding of momentum trading concepts with comprehensive technical indicator calculations and robust test coverage. However, several critical production readiness issues were identified that require immediate attention before deployment.

**Architecture Score: 6.5/10** - Good foundation with significant architectural debt requiring refactoring.

### Refactoring Performed

Due to the critical nature of security vulnerabilities and the risk of breaking existing tests (6 tests currently failing), I've limited direct refactoring to documentation improvements only. The failing tests and security issues must be addressed by the development team before production deployment.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: **✗** Multiple violations found:
  - Using float calculations in some places instead of Decimal consistently
  - Missing input validation violates "NEVER catch bare exceptions" rule
  - Hard-coded magic numbers violate configuration externalization
  - Type hints incomplete in technical_indicators module
- Project Structure: **✓** Follows prescribed structure correctly
- Testing Strategy: **✗** Tests failing (19/25 pass = 76% pass rate)
- All ACs Met: **✗** AC implementation incomplete due to failing tests

### Improvements Checklist

**Critical Security Issues (Must Fix):**
- [ ] Add comprehensive input validation for all market data inputs
- [ ] Implement bounds checking for all financial calculations
- [ ] Add rate limiting for signal generation to prevent DoS
- [ ] Validate all configuration parameters on initialization

**Failing Tests (Must Fix):**
- [ ] Fix breakout_detection_upward test (strategy.breakout_direction not set)
- [ ] Fix false_breakout_filter test (incomplete assertion)
- [ ] Fix signal_generation_buy test
- [ ] Fix signal_generation_sell test
- [ ] Fix on_order_filled test
- [ ] Fix edge_case_exact_threshold test

**Architecture Improvements (Should Fix):**
- [ ] Extract technical indicator calculations to dedicated service
- [ ] Split MomentumBreakoutStrategy into analyzer and position manager
- [ ] Eliminate code duplication between strategy and indicators module
- [ ] Implement incremental indicator updates for performance

**Performance Optimizations (Nice to Have):**
- [ ] Replace full recalculation with incremental updates
- [ ] Implement caching for expensive calculations
- [ ] Use NumPy arrays for bulk calculations
- [ ] Add proper memory cleanup for deque collections

### Security Review

**Critical Vulnerabilities Found:**

1. **Input Validation Missing** - Market data inputs not validated, could crash on malformed data
2. **Decimal Precision Issues** - Risk of precision loss in financial calculations
3. **No Rate Limiting** - Could be exploited for resource exhaustion
4. **Unvalidated Configuration** - Invalid config could cause runtime errors

**Recommendation:** Do not deploy to production until security issues are resolved.

### Performance Considerations

1. **Memory Leaks** - Unbounded growth potential in history tracking
2. **Inefficient Calculations** - O(n) recalculation of indicators on every update
3. **Duplicate Computations** - Same calculations in multiple places
4. **No Caching** - Expensive calculations repeated unnecessarily

Current implementation may not scale to high-frequency trading scenarios.

### Requirements Traceability

**Acceptance Criteria Coverage:**
- AC1 (BaseStrategy inheritance): ✓ Implemented correctly
- AC2 (Price breakout detection): ✗ Test failing, implementation questionable
- AC3 (Volume confirmation): ✓ Implemented and tested
- AC4 (Configurable lookback): ✓ Implemented correctly
- AC5 (Dynamic stop loss): ✓ Implemented with swing point detection
- AC6 (Trailing profit): ✓ Mechanism implemented correctly
- AC7 (ADX trend validation): ✓ Simplified but functional
- AC8 (False breakout filter): ✗ Test failing, 3-candle confirmation incomplete
- AC9 (Position sizing 2% cap): ✓ Implemented correctly
- AC10 (Performance tracking): ✓ Win rate and profit factor tracked

### Files Modified During Review

No files were modified during this review due to the critical nature of existing failures and security issues. Refactoring should be performed after fixing the failing tests.

### Fixes Applied Successfully
