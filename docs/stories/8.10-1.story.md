6. Override mechanism for manual go/no-go decisions
7. Validation metadata tracking (timestamps, versions)
8. Parallel validation execution support
9. Validation pipeline configuration
10. Historical validation tracking

### Module Structure
[Source: PRD Epic 8 - Story 8.10]

Create the following structure in `genesis/validation/`:

```python
# genesis/validation/__init__.py
from .base import Validator, ValidationResult, ValidationCheck, CheckStatus
from .orchestrator import ValidationOrchestrator
from .report import ValidationReport, ReportGenerator
from .exceptions import ValidationError, ValidationTimeout

__all__ = [
    'Validator',
    'ValidationResult',
    'ValidationCheck',
    'CheckStatus',
    'ValidationOrchestrator',
    'ValidationReport',
    'ReportGenerator',
    'ValidationError',
    'ValidationTimeout'
]
```

[Source: PRD Epic 8 - Story 8.10]

```python
# genesis/validation/base.py
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Dict, Any, Optional
from enum import Enum
from datetime import datetime

class CheckStatus(Enum):
    PASSED = "passed"
    FAILED = "failed"
    WARNING = "warning"
    SKIPPED = "skipped"

@dataclass
class ValidationCheck:
    id: str
    name: str
    description: str
    status: CheckStatus
    details: str
    is_blocking: bool
    evidence: Dict[str, Any]
    duration_ms: float

@dataclass
class ValidationResult:
    check_id: str
    status: CheckStatus
    message: str
    evidence: Dict[str, Any]
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]

class Validator:
    """Abstract base class for all validators"""

    async def run_validation(self, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> ValidationResult:
        """Run validation and return result"""
        raise NotImplementedError
```

### Orchestrator Implementation
[Source: PRD Epic 8]

```python
# genesis/validation/orchestrator.py
class ValidationOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.validators = {}
        self.results = []
        self.pipeline_config = {}

    async def run_full_validation(self) -> ValidationReport:
        """Run all validators and generate comprehensive report"""
        # Implementation details from PRD
        pass
```
