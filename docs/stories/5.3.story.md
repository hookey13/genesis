- Add drawdown-specific intervention messages
[Source: architecture/components.md#tilt-detector]

### Configuration Requirements
**Trading Rules Configuration:**
- Add drawdown recovery section to `config/trading_rules.yaml`
- Configure drawdown thresholds per tier:
  - Hunter: 10% drawdown trigger
  - Strategist: 15% drawdown trigger  
  - Architect: 20% drawdown trigger
- Define recovery stages and position size multipliers:
  - Stage 0: 25% position size
  - Stage 1: 50% position size  
  - Stage 2: 75% position size
  - Stage 3: 100% position size (fully recovered)
- Set forced break parameters:
  - Trigger: 3 consecutive losses (default)
  - Duration: 30 minutes minimum break
  - Recovery requirement: Journal entry required before resuming
- Recovery messages location: `config/recovery_messages.yaml`
- Daily profit target reduction: 50% during recovery

### Technical Constraints
- Must use Decimal for all financial calculations (no float)
- Use datetime.now(timezone.utc) for timestamps (not datetime.utcnow())
- Follow @requires_tier decorator pattern for tier restrictions
- Recovery protocol should be available from Hunter tier (similar to Kelly sizing)
- All database operations must use SQLiteRepository patterns
- Event publishing must use EventBus with proper EventType enums
- Follow existing RecoveryProtocolManager patterns for consistency
