└── engine/

```

### Technical Context from Architecture

#### BaseStrategy Abstract Class Pattern
From `genesis/strategies/base.py`, inherit and implement:
- `async def analyze(self, market_data: Dict) -> Optional[Signal]`
- `async def manage_positions(self) -> List[Signal]`
- State management via StrategyState enum
- Configuration loading via Pydantic settings

#### Signal Model Structure
From `genesis/core/models.py`:
```python
@dataclass
class Signal:
    type: SignalType  # BUY, SELL, CLOSE
    symbol: str
    price: Decimal
    quantity: Decimal
    confidence: float  # 0.0 to 1.0
    strategy_name: str
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]  # Additional context
```

#### Kelly Criterion Formula
Position size = (p * b - q) / b
Where:
- p = probability of winning
- q = probability of losing (1 - p)
- b = odds received on the wager
- Cap at 2% maximum per risk management rules

#### MarketAnalyzer Integration
The MarketAnalyzer (from Story 10.1) provides:
- `analyze_market_data()` returns List[ArbitrageOpportunity]
- ArbitrageOpportunity contains: symbol, exchanges, prices, profit_pct, confidence
- Minimum profit threshold: 0.3%
- Latency requirement: <10ms per pair

#### Performance Metrics Required
- Win Rate = winning_trades / total_trades
- Profit Factor = gross_profit / gross_loss
- Sharpe Ratio = (returns - risk_free_rate) / std_dev
- Maximum Drawdown tracking
- Recovery time measurement

### Testing Standards and Requirements

#### Test Framework Configuration
- **Framework:** pytest 8.0.0 with pytest-asyncio
- **Location:** `tests/unit/test_simple_arbitrage.py`
- **Coverage Target:** >85% for strategy code, 100% for risk calculations
- **Mock Library:** pytest-mock for MarketAnalyzer mocking

#### Required Test Cases
1. **Signal Generation Tests**
   - Valid arbitrage opportunity generates signal
   - Below threshold opportunity returns None
   - Low confidence opportunity rejected
   - Position size too small returns None

2. **Risk Management Tests**
   - Stop loss triggers at 1% drawdown
   - Take profit triggers at 0.5% gain
   - Position expires after timeout
   - Multiple position management

3. **State Persistence Tests**
   - Save and load strategy state
   - Recovery after crash simulation
   - Active positions preserved

4. **Performance Tests**
   - Signal generation <100ms
   - Memory usage <10MB
   - Concurrent position handling

#### Test Data Fixtures
```python
# Example fixture structure
@pytest.fixture
def mock_arbitrage_opportunity():
    return ArbitrageOpportunity(
        symbol="BTCUSDT",
        exchange_buy="binance",
        exchange_sell="kraken",
        buy_price=Decimal("50000"),
        sell_price=Decimal("50200"),
        profit_pct=Decimal("0.4"),
        confidence=0.75,
        max_quantity=Decimal("0.1")
    )
```
