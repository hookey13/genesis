### Deployment Strategy
[Source: architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment.md]
- **Strategy**: Blue-green deployment with manual cutover
- **Environments**:
  - Development: Local Docker container
  - Paper Trading: VPS with paper trading flag (48 hours minimum)
  - Production: Primary VPS (Singapore)
  - Disaster Recovery: Backup VPS (San Francisco) - activated at $5k+
- **Rollback Triggers**:
  - 3 failed trades in 10 minutes
  - System crash loop
  - Tilt detection spike
- **Recovery Time Objective**: <5 minutes for critical issues

### Security Requirements
[Source: architecture/security.md]
- **Secrets Management**: Environment variables only, never in code
- **Dependency Security**: pip-audit for vulnerability scanning
- **API Security**: API keys via environment variables at runtime
- **Code Requirements**:
  - NEVER hardcode secrets
  - No secrets in logs or error messages
  - Access secrets via configuration service only

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Framework**: pytest 8.0.0 with pytest-asyncio
- **Coverage Goals**: 100% for money paths, 90% for risk/tilt
- **CI Integration**: GitHub Actions runs all tests on push
- **Test Organization**:
  - Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_{module}.py`
  - Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_{workflow}.py`
- **Docker Testing**: Docker compose for end-to-end tests

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Python Version**: 3.11.8 exclusively - no 3.12 features
- **Formatting**: Black formatter (line length 88)
- **Linting**: Ruff linter with configuration
- **Type Hints**: Mandatory for all functions
- **Critical Rules**:
  - NEVER use float for money - always Decimal
  - NEVER use print() - always use structlog
  - ALWAYS use database transactions for multi-step operations
  - ALWAYS validate state after restart

### Deployment-Specific Configuration
- **Image Size Target**: <500MB for production Docker image
- **Health Check Requirements**: All services must expose health endpoints
- **Version Tracking**: Git tags for each deployment
- **Audit Requirements**: Full deployment history with rollback capability
- **Paper Trading Validation**: 48 hours minimum before production
- **Staging Validation**: Must pass all integration tests before production

### File Paths for Implementation
- Docker files: `docker/Dockerfile`, `docker/docker-compose.yml`, `docker/docker-compose.prod.yml`
- CI/CD workflows: `.github/workflows/test.yml`, `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Deployment scripts: `scripts/deploy.sh`, `scripts/rollback.sh`
- Health check API: `genesis/api/server.py` (add endpoints if not exists)
- Kubernetes (future): `k8s/` directory for manifests
- Terraform (future): `terraform/` directory for IaC

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-29

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation of production-grade containerized deployment infrastructure. The multi-stage Docker build is well-optimized, achieving the <500MB target through proper layer caching and minimal runtime dependencies. The blue-green deployment strategy with automatic rollback provides the zero-downtime capability required for production trading operations. CI/CD pipelines are comprehensive with proper staging validation gates.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring required - implementation follows best practices and meets all requirements.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ All Python 3.11.8 compatibility maintained, proper use of structlog
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows prescribed directory structure (docker/, scripts/, .github/workflows/)
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive test coverage for deployment flows
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 8 acceptance criteria fully implemented and validated

### Improvements Checklist

All critical items have been implemented:

- [x] Docker multi-stage build with security scanning
- [x] Health check endpoints with readiness/liveness probes
- [x] Blue-green deployment with connection draining
- [x] Automated rollback on health check failures
- [x] Deployment audit trail with version tracking
- [x] GitHub Actions CI/CD with staging gates
- [x] Kubernetes manifests prepared for future migration
- [x] Infrastructure as Code foundation established

Future enhancements (non-blocking):

- [ ] Add container vulnerability scanning (Trivy/Snyk) in CI pipeline
- [ ] Implement deployment metrics collection for observability
- [ ] Add Prometheus metrics endpoint for monitoring
- [ ] Create Grafana dashboards for deployment visibility

### Security Review

Security implementation is robust:
- Multi-stage builds with security scanning (pip-audit, safety, bandit)
- Non-root user (genesis:1000) for container runtime
- Secrets managed via environment variables, never in code
- Proper .dockerignore to exclude sensitive files
- Health check endpoints do not expose sensitive data

### Performance Considerations

Performance optimizations are well-implemented:
- Docker image successfully optimized to <500MB using slim base and multi-stage builds
- Efficient layer caching reduces build times
- Health checks use minimal resources with proper timeouts
- Blue-green deployment ensures zero downtime during updates
- Connection draining prevents dropped requests during cutover

### Files Modified During Review

No files required modification - all implementations meet quality standards.
