## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Story 3.4 completed the micro-behavior analytics infrastructure, providing comprehensive behavioral tracking including click latency, order modifications, focus patterns, and configuration changes. All behavioral data is now being collected and stored, with real-time processing meeting the <50ms requirement. The tilt detection system from story 3.2 and intervention protocols from story 3.3 are fully operational.

**Available Behavioral Metrics from Story 3.4:**
- `BehavioralMetrics` class in `genesis/analytics/behavioral_metrics.py`
- Real-time click latency tracking via `track_click_latency(latency_ms: int)`
- Order modification monitoring via `track_order_modification(order_id: str, modification_type: str)`
- Focus pattern detection via `FocusPatterns` class in `genesis/tilt/indicators/focus_patterns.py`
- Configuration change tracking via `ConfigTracker` in `genesis/analytics/config_tracker.py`

**Integration Points from Story 3.2-3.3:**
- `TiltDetector` class in `genesis/tilt/detector.py` with `update_metrics()` and `check_intervention_required()` methods
- `InterventionManager` in `genesis/tilt/interventions.py` for lockout enforcement
- `RecoveryProtocol` in `genesis/tilt/recovery_protocols.py` for graduated recovery
- `TiltProfile` model with `current_tilt_score`, `tilt_level`, and `recovery_required` fields

**Data Models** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]

Relevant existing models:
- `Account`: Tracks balance, tier status, tier_started_at, gates_passed
  - Current tier locked by state machine
  - Has relationship with TiltProfile

- `TiltProfile`: Behavioral baseline and psychological state
  - `current_tilt_score`: 0-100 scale

  - `recovery_required`: Boolean for recovery protocol
  - `journal_entries_required`: Outstanding journal count

- `TradingSession`: Groups trades for analysis
  - `session_type`: NORMAL|RECOVERY|PAPER
  - Can track paper trading sessions

**Database Schema Additions** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]

Will need new tables following SQLite patterns:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tier_transitions (
    transition_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    account_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES accounts(account_id),
    from_tier TEXT NOT NULL,
    to_tier TEXT NOT NULL,
    readiness_score INTEGER,
    checklist_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    funeral_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    paper_trading_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    adjustment_period_start TIMESTAMP,
    adjustment_period_end TIMESTAMP,
    transition_status TEXT CHECK (transition_status IN ('APPROACHING', 'READY', 'IN_PROGRESS', 'COMPLETED')),
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS paper_trading_sessions (
    session_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    account_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES accounts(account_id),
    strategy_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    required_duration_hours INTEGER NOT NULL,
    actual_duration_hours INTEGER,
    success_rate DECIMAL(5,2),
    total_trades INTEGER DEFAULT 0,

    started_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    completed_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS transition_checklists (
    checklist_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    transition_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES tier_transitions(transition_id),
    item_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    item_response TEXT,
    completed_at TIMESTAMP,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Component Integration** [Source: architecture/components.md]

**Tier State Machine** responsibilities:
- Physical enforcement of tier restrictions
- Key interfaces:
  - `check_tier_requirement(required: Tier) -> bool`
  - `evaluate_progression() -> TierTransition`
  - `force_demotion(reason: str) -> None`
- Located in `genesis/engine/state_machine.py`

**Tilt Detector** responsibilities:
- Real-time behavioral monitoring
- Key interfaces:
  - `update_metrics(action: UserAction) -> TiltScore`
  - `check_intervention_required() -> Intervention`
- Located in `genesis/tilt/detector.py`

**Strategy Engine** responsibilities:
- Strategy selection and loading by tier
- Key interfaces:
  - `load_strategies(tier: Tier) -> List[Strategy]`
- Located in `genesis/strategies/loader.py`

### Critical Implementation Notes

1. **Valley of Death Protection**: The $1,800-$2,000 range is the most dangerous period. Many traders blow up their accounts here due to overconfidence and inability to adapt to new strategies.

2. **Forced Paper Trading**: New execution methods (like iceberg orders for Hunter tier) must be practiced in simulation before live trading. This prevents costly mistakes during the learning curve.

3. **Psychological Preparation**: The checklist and funeral ceremony are not just rituals - they force conscious acknowledgment of required behavioral changes.

4. **Adjustment Period**: The 48-hour reduced limits give time to adapt without catastrophic losses. Gradually increasing limits prevents shock.

5. **Database Transactions**: All tier transition operations must use database transactions to ensure consistency. Partial transitions could leave the system in an invalid state.

6. **State Machine Integration**: All tier changes MUST go through the state machine - never modify tier directly in the database.

7. **Error Handling Requirements**: All tier transition operations must include comprehensive error handling:
   - Database transaction failures: Rollback and retry with exponential backoff
   - State machine conflicts: Queue transition for retry after current state resolves
   - Paper trading failures: Extend paper trading period, do not block indefinitely
   - Checklist validation errors: Provide clear user feedback on missing items
   - Network/API failures during transition: Cache state locally and retry

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Section**

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- Framework: pytest 8.0.0 with pytest-asyncio
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_{module}.py`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_{workflow}.py`
- Coverage requirement: 90% for tilt/risk components
- Database testing: In-memory SQLite for speed
- Test data: Builder pattern with fixtures in `tests/fixtures/`
- Mocking: pytest-mock with faker for test data

Critical test scenarios:
- Approaching tier with tilt events (should delay transition)
- Paper trading failure (should block tier progression)
- Incomplete checklist (should prevent transition)
- Adjustment period interruption (should extend period)
- Emergency demotion during transition (should cancel transition)
- Database transaction failures during transition (should rollback cleanly)
- Concurrent tilt detection during transition (should pause transition)
- State machine conflicts (should queue and retry)

**Test File Locations:**
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_valley_of_death_monitor.py`, `tests/unit/test_tier_readiness.py`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_tier_transition_workflow.py`, `tests/integration/test_paper_trading_workflow.py`
- Migration tests: `tests/unit/test_migration_005.py`

**Testing Patterns:**
- Use `pytest.mark.asyncio` for async test methods
- Use `@pytest.fixture` for test data builders
- Mock external dependencies with `unittest.mock`
- Use in-memory SQLite for database tests
- Assert using pytest assertions, not unittest

**Coverage Requirements:**
- Minimum 90% coverage for all tilt/transition modules
- 100% coverage for critical state machine integration points
- All error paths must be tested

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-26

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Outstanding implementation quality with sophisticated tier transition protection mechanisms. The implementation demonstrates deep understanding of trader psychology and risk management during the critical $2k threshold transition. All 8 acceptance criteria are fully implemented with comprehensive protection layers including proximity monitoring, readiness assessment, paper trading enforcement, psychological preparation, and gradual adjustment periods. Code follows all project standards with excellent async patterns, proper Decimal usage for money, and comprehensive error handling.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: genesis/data/models_db.py
  - **Change**: Renamed 'metadata' column to 'metrics_metadata' in BehavioralMetricsDB
  - **Why**: 'metadata' is a reserved word in SQLAlchemy causing import errors
  - **How**: Prevents SQLAlchemy InvalidRequestError and allows proper model initialization

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ PascalCase classes, snake_case functions, type hints, async patterns
- Project Structure: ✓ Proper module organization in genesis/tilt/, genesis/engine/
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Missing unit tests for 6/9 components (though integration test is comprehensive)
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 8 acceptance criteria fully implemented and functional
