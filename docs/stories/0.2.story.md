### File Locations
**[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#genesis/exchange/]**
- `/genesis/exchange/gateway.py` - Binance API wrapper (needs completion)
- `/genesis/exchange/ws_manager.py` - WebSocket manager (exists, needs implementation)
- `/genesis/exchange/websocket_manager.py` - Legacy WebSocket file (may need consolidation)
- `/genesis/exchange/circuit_breaker_v2.py` - Circuit breaker implementation (needs completion)
- `/genesis/exchange/rate_limiter.py` - Rate limiting (needs implementation)
- `/genesis/exchange/health_monitor.py` - Exchange health monitoring
- `/genesis/exchange/models.py` - Exchange-specific data models
- `/genesis/exchange/time_sync.py` - NTP synchronization (already implemented)

### Binance API Specifications
**[Source: architecture/external-apis.md#Binance Spot Trading API]**

**REST API:**
- Base URL: `https://api.binance.com` (production) or testnet URL for testing
- Authentication: HMAC SHA256 signature with API key/secret
- Rate Limits:
  - 1200 weight units per minute
  - 50 orders per 10 seconds
  - 160,000 orders per day
- Key Endpoints:
  - `/api/v3/order` - Place and check orders
  - `/api/v3/account` - Account information
  - `/api/v3/depth` - Order book data
- Use `recvWindow` of 5000ms for time sync tolerance

**WebSocket Streams:**
- Base URL: `wss://stream.binance.com:9443`
- Connection Limits: 5 connections per IP, 24-hour forced disconnect
- Required Streams:
  - `@trade` - Real-time trades
  - `@ticker` - 24hr ticker statistics
  - `@depth20@100ms` - Order book depth (top 20 levels)
  - `@kline_1m` - 1-minute candlestick data
- Heartbeat: Send pong frame every 30 seconds to maintain connection

### Error Handling Standards
**[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#error-handling-strategy.md]**
- **Retry Policy**: Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, max 30s
- **Circuit Breaker**: Open after 5 failures in 30 seconds, half-open after 60s
- **Timeouts**: Connect: 5s, Read: 10s, Total: 30s
- **ALWAYS use asyncio for I/O operations** - blocking I/O freezes event loop
- **NEVER catch bare exceptions** - always catch specific exception types
- **Use context managers** for resource cleanup

### Exchange Data Models
**[Source: architecture/data-models.md]**

**Order Model Fields:**
- `order_id`: UUID (internal)
- `exchange_order_id`: String (Binance order ID)
- `type`: Enum[MARKET|LIMIT|STOP_LOSS]
- `side`: Enum[BUY|SELL]
- `price`: Decimal (use Decimal, never float!)
- `quantity`: Decimal
- `filled_quantity`: Decimal
- `status`: Enum[PENDING|PARTIAL|FILLED|CANCELLED]
- `latency_ms`: Integer (track execution latency)
- `slippage_percent`: Decimal

**MarketState Model Fields:**

- `liquidity_score`: Decimal

### Event Bus Integration
**[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#Architectural and Design Patterns]**
- Use publish-subscribe pattern via internal event bus
- Events should be strongly typed with Pydantic models
- Connect exchange events for real-time processing
- Ensure proper event ordering and delivery guarantees

### Environment Variables Required
**Configuration for Exchange Integration:**
- `BINANCE_API_KEY`: API key for Binance authentication
- `BINANCE_SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for HMAC SHA256 signature
- `BINANCE_TESTNET`: Set to "true" for testnet, "false" for production
- `BINANCE_TESTNET_URL`: Testnet API URL (e.g., https://testnet.binance.vision)
- `BINANCE_WS_URL`: WebSocket URL (wss://stream.binance.com:9443 for production)
- `RECV_WINDOW`: Time window for requests in ms (default: 5000)

### Technical Constraints
**[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]**
- **100% test coverage required for money-handling code**
- **ALWAYS use database transactions for multi-step operations**
- **ALWAYS validate state after restart**
- **Stay below 80% of rate limit capacity**
- **Maintain 3 WebSocket connections for redundancy**

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-28

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The exchange integration implementation demonstrates **strong engineering practices** with a quality score of 85%. The codebase shows excellent separation of concerns, comprehensive error handling, and proper async patterns. WebSocket manager, circuit breaker V2, and gateway implementations are well-architected with extensive unit test coverage. However, critical gaps exist in meeting specific acceptance criteria.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring performed - implementation is architecturally sound with clean code patterns already in place.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Excellent adherence to async patterns, Decimal usage, error handling
- Project Structure: ✓ Proper module organization in genesis/exchange/
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Missing required 1-hour stability test, partial coverage
- All ACs Met: ✗ Missing order-specific rate limits and 1-hour stability test

### Improvements Checklist

**Critical (Must Fix for Story Completion):**
- [ ] Create 1-hour WebSocket stability test as specified in AC #1 and Task 6
- [ ] Implement order-specific rate limits (50 orders/10s, 160k/day) in rate_limiter.py
- [ ] Update WebSocketManager to use EnhancedCircuitBreaker V2 instead of old circuit breaker

**Nice to Have (Future Enhancement):**
- [ ] Add comprehensive metrics collection for production monitoring
- [ ] Implement alerting for circuit breaker trips and rate limit violations
- [ ] Create end-to-end testnet integration test suite
- [ ] Add configuration validation for all exchange parameters

### Security Review

**Strengths:**
- Proper use of SecretStr for API credentials
- Pydantic models for request/response validation
- TLS for all connections with appropriate timeouts
- No sensitive information leaked in error messages

**Minor Concerns:**
- Mock exchange responses may not match real security constraints
- Some debug logging could expose timing information

### Performance Considerations

**Strengths:**
- Efficient async/await patterns throughout
- Proper connection pooling (3 WebSocket connections)
- Message buffering with bounded deque (maxlen=1000)
- Exponential backoff properly capped at 30 seconds

**Potential Issues:**
- Gap detection REST backfill could cause latency spikes under heavy load
- Consider implementing bulk message processing for high-frequency updates

### Files Modified During Review

None - code quality is good, issues are missing functionality rather than code problems.

### Gate Status

Gate: **CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/0.2-complete-exchange-integration.yml
- Critical missing: 1-hour stability test (AC #1)
- Critical missing: Order-specific rate limits (AC #5 partial)
- Minor issue: Circuit breaker V2 integration incomplete

### Recommended Status

[✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items above]

**Critical Requirements for Story Completion:**
1. Implement the 1-hour WebSocket stability test that was explicitly required in AC #1 and Task 6
2. Add order-specific rate limiting (50 orders/10 seconds, 160,000 orders/day) to fully meet AC #5
3. Update WebSocketManager to use the new EnhancedCircuitBreaker V2

The implementation shows excellent engineering quality but cannot be marked complete without these specific acceptance criteria being fully met.
