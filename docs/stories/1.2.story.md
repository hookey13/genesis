## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
From Story 1.1 completion:
- Project structure established with genesis/ package directory
- Configuration management implemented using Pydantic in config/settings.py
- ccxt==4.2.25 already included in requirements/base.txt
- Structured logging configured with structlog==24.1.0
- Testing framework ready with pytest==8.0.0

### File Locations
Based on [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- Exchange integration code goes in `genesis/exchange/` directory
- Main gateway wrapper: `genesis/exchange/gateway.py`
- WebSocket manager: `genesis/exchange/websocket_manager.py`
- Circuit breaker: `genesis/exchange/circuit_breaker.py`
- Time synchronization: `genesis/exchange/time_sync.py`
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_gateway.py`, `test_websocket_manager.py`, etc.
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_binance_integration.py`

### Binance API Configuration
From [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#Binance Spot Trading API]:
- **REST Base URL:** https://api.binance.com
- **WebSocket URL:** wss://stream.binance.com:9443
- **Authentication:** HMAC SHA256 signature with API key/secret
- **Rate Limits:** 1200 requests/minute (weight-based), 50 orders/10s, 160k orders/day
- **Key Endpoints:**
  - GET /api/v3/account - Account balance
  - POST /api/v3/order - Place order
  - DELETE /api/v3/order - Cancel order
  - GET /api/v3/order - Query order status
  - GET /api/v3/depth - Order book
  - GET /api/v3/klines - Historical candles
  - GET /api/v3/ticker/24hr - 24hr ticker

### WebSocket Configuration
From [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#Binance WebSocket Streams API]:
- **Connection Pool:** 3 connections (execution, monitoring, backup)
- **Streams to Subscribe:**
  - `<symbol>@trade` - Real-time trades
  - `<symbol>@depth20@100ms` - Order book (20 levels, 100ms updates)
  - `<symbol>@kline_1m` - 1-minute candles
  - `<symbol>@ticker` - 24hr rolling ticker
- **Heartbeat:** Send pong every 30 seconds
- **Auto-reconnect:** Exponential backoff on disconnect
- **Message buffering:** Catch up missed messages via REST during reconnection

### Error Handling Strategy
From [Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#External API Errors]:
- **Retry Policy:** Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, max 30s
- **Circuit Breaker:** Open after 5 failures in 30s, half-open after 60s
- **Timeout Config:** Connect: 5s, Read: 10s, Total: 30s
- **Error Translation:** Map Binance errors to domain exceptions
- **Logging:** Use structlog with correlation IDs

### Data Models
From [Source: architecture/data-models.md]:
- **Order Model Fields:** order_id, exchange_order_id, type, side, price, quantity, filled_quantity, status, latency_ms, slippage_percent
- **MarketState Fields:** symbol, state (DEAD|NORMAL|VOLATILE|PANIC|MAINTENANCE), volatility_atr, spread_basis_points, volume_24h

### Coding Standards
From [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- **Type hints mandatory** for all functions
- **Use Decimal for money**, never float
- **Use structlog for logging**, never print()
- **Always use asyncio for I/O operations**
- **Context managers for resource cleanup**
- **Specific exception handling**, no bare except
- **Client order IDs for idempotency**

### Critical Implementation Notes
From [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#Integration Notes]:
- Use ccxt library's built-in rate limit handling
- Maintain circuit breaker with exponential backoff (2^n seconds, max 60s)
- Track weight consumption, stay below 80% capacity
- Use recvWindow of 5000ms for time synchronization tolerance
- Implement heartbeat/pong every 30 seconds for WebSocket
- Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff on disconnect
- Buffer missed messages during reconnection using REST API catchup
- Cache exchangeInfo for 24 hours (trading rules rarely change)
- Check system status before market open
- Use server time to sync local clock (critical for signatures)
- If maintenance detected, enter MarketState.MAINTENANCE automatically

## Testing
- Test files should be placed in `tests/unit/` following pattern `test_{module}.py`
- Use pytest==8.0.0 with pytest-asyncio for async tests
- Use pytest-mock for mocking external dependencies
- Use VCR.py for recording/replaying API responses in integration tests
- Coverage goals: 100% for critical exchange interaction code
- Test scenarios must include: connection failures, rate limit hits, WebSocket disconnects, circuit breaker trips
