notes: |
  Excellent implementation with all issues successfully resolved by the development team.
  All 10 acceptance criteria are fully implemented and tested with comprehensive coverage.
  
  Key improvements made:
  - Fixed test fixture dependency issues in sample_config_with_overrides and sample_config_with_variants
  - Fixed cross-field validation test assertion to match actual error message format
  - Fixed A/B testing variant loading to properly merge variant overrides with base config
  - Added 7 comprehensive integration tests for hot-reload functionality
  - Added 8 performance benchmark tests validating all performance requirements
  - Created detailed configuration schema documentation at docs/configuration-schema.md
  
  The configuration management system demonstrates excellent engineering practices with proper
  security considerations, comprehensive feature set, and clean code architecture. The use of
  Pydantic for validation, async patterns for file watching, and proper audit logging show
  mature development practices. All tests are now passing (31 unit + 7 integration + 8 performance).
  
  This story is ready for production deployment.
