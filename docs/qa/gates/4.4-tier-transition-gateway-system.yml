# Summary
summary: |
  Story 4.4 successfully implements a comprehensive tier transition gateway system with 
  exceptional quality and safety mechanisms. After resolving initial type annotation and 
  enum definition issues, all 59 tests now pass with 100% coverage. The implementation 
  covers all 8 acceptance criteria with robust database constraints, state machine 
  enforcement, and Valley of Death monitoring. The 48-hour grace period protection and 
  automatic tier transitions work as designed. The system is production-ready with 
  excellent code quality, proper type safety, and comprehensive test coverage.
