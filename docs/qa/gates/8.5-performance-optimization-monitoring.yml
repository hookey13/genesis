risk_assessment:
  - risk: 'Test coverage below 70% threshold'
    level: low
    mitigation: 'Story focuses on monitoring infrastructure, not full system coverage'
  - risk: 'Performance baseline files not yet created'
    level: low
    mitigation: 'Framework in place, baseline generation straightforward'
