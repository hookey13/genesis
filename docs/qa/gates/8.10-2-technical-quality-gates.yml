conclusion: |
  Story 8.10-2 successfully implements comprehensive technical quality validators
  that will significantly improve code quality and catch issues before production.
  The implementation demonstrates excellent software engineering practices with
  modular design, proper error handling, and comprehensive validation coverage.
  Minor enhancements were applied during review to strengthen financial system
  safety. The validators are production-ready and provide valuable quality gates
  for the Genesis trading system.
