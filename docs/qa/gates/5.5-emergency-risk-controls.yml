review_notes: |
  Exceptional implementation of emergency risk controls demonstrating production-ready quality.
  This critical safety system follows fail-safe principles and provides comprehensive protection
  across all major risk scenarios. All 8 acceptance criteria are fully met with exemplary code
  quality, proper financial precision (Decimal usage), async patterns, and extensive testing.
  The architecture is clean with proper separation of concerns and dependency injection.
  Performance requirements (<5 second response) are met. No security vulnerabilities identified.
  Minor optional enhancements suggested for notification systems and forensic data preservation.
