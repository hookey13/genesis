security_assessment:
  strengths:
    - 'Industry-standard RFC 6238 TOTP implementation'
    - 'Cryptographically secure secret generation'
    - 'Backup codes hashed before storage'
    - 'Rate limiting prevents brute force'
    - 'Comprehensive audit logging'
    - 'Vault integration for secure storage'
  issues_resolved:
    - 'Fixed hardcoded IP address in audit logs'
    - 'Added password verification for 2FA disable'

implementation_notes:
  - 'TOTP window tolerance of 1 (30 seconds) handles clock skew'
  - 'Backup codes are single-use only'
  - 'Admin accounts must have 2FA before production'
  - 'Compatible with all standard authenticator apps'
  - 'Emergency bypass via backup codes tested'
