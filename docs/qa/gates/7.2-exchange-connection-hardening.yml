notes: |
  Story 7.2 demonstrates production-grade exchange connectivity with comprehensive 
  failover mechanisms. The implementation addresses all critical aspects of reliable
  exchange interaction including connection management, rate limiting, failure detection,
  and recovery. The fixes applied during review ensure monetary precision is maintained
  throughout the system. This story is ready for production deployment.
