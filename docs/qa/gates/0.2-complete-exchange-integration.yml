# Quality Gate Decision for Story 0.2
schema: 1
story: "0.2"
story_title: "Complete Exchange Integration"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Critical acceptance criteria not fully met: missing 1-hour stability test and order-specific rate limits"
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"
updated: "2025-08-28T14:30:00Z"

# Issues requiring attention
top_issues:
  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "1-hour WebSocket stability test not implemented as required by AC #1"
    suggested_action: "Create integration test with actual 1-hour WebSocket connection monitoring"
    
  - id: "IMPL-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "Order-specific rate limits (50/10s, 160k/day) not implemented"
    suggested_action: "Extend rate_limiter.py to track order placement limits separately from general API limits"
    
  - id: "INTG-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "WebSocketManager still uses old CircuitBreaker instead of V2"
    suggested_action: "Update imports to use EnhancedCircuitBreaker from circuit_breaker_v2.py"

# Risk Assessment
risk_summary:
  totals:
    critical: 0
    high: 2  # Missing stability test, incomplete rate limiting
    medium: 1  # Circuit breaker integration
    low: 0
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Implement 1-hour WebSocket stability test before production"
      - "Add order-specific rate limiting to prevent API violations"
    monitor:
      - "WebSocket gap detection performance under load"
      - "Circuit breaker recovery patterns in production"
