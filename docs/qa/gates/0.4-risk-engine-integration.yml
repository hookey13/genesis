implementation_quality:
  architecture: excellent
  code_quality: excellent
  test_design: good
  documentation: good

key_strengths:
  - 'Comprehensive risk validation at multiple levels (order, position, portfolio)'
  - 'Clean separation between trading loop orchestration and risk engine logic'
  - 'Strong type safety with Pydantic models for configuration'
  - 'Proper event correlation for audit trail'
  - 'Configuration-driven tier limits with YAML'

areas_for_improvement:
  - 'Test implementation needs fixes for proper mocking'
  - 'Coverage needs significant improvement'
  - 'Consider adding performance monitoring for risk checks'

overall_assessment: |
  The risk engine integration is well-architected and properly implemented, following
  established patterns and best practices. All acceptance criteria are met in the
  production code. However, test failures and low coverage present reliability concerns
  that should be addressed before considering this story complete. The issues are
  relatively minor and focused on test implementation rather than production code problems.
