# Final assessment
assessment_summary: |
  This is an exemplary implementation of a comprehensive load testing suite.
  The code demonstrates excellent understanding of performance testing principles
  with realistic user simulation, proper metrics collection, and robust error
  handling. The integration with CI/CD and automated regression detection makes
  this production-ready. The only minor consideration is monitoring for memory
  leaks during extended endurance tests, which is already addressed in the
  implementation with memory profiling capabilities.
