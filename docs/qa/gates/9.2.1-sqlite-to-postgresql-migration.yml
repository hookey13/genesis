notes: |
  This is a critical foundation migration for the Genesis trading platform. The implementation
  demonstrates excellent engineering with comprehensive security measures, data integrity 
  guarantees, and production-ready functionality.
  
  UPDATE: All critical issues identified in the initial review have been successfully addressed:
  - SQL injection vulnerabilities fixed with input validation and parameterized queries
  - Password exposure eliminated with secure credential handling
  - Zero-downtime hot cutover fully implemented with 8-step process
  - Complete rollback mechanism with automatic backup restoration
  - Atomic transactions with SERIALIZABLE isolation level
  - Cross-platform concurrent migration prevention
  
  The implementation now includes excellent checksum verification, comprehensive testing,
  PostgreSQL-specific optimizations, and all required production features. This provides
  a robust, secure foundation for migrating Genesis trading operations to PostgreSQL.
  
  Recommend thorough production-scale testing before deployment to validate performance
  with actual data volumes.
