summary: |
  Story 8.10-4 has been successfully completed with all critical issues resolved.
  
  The Dev team has refactored all 5 operational readiness validators to:
  1. Properly inherit from the base Validator class
  2. Implement the required run_validation(context: ValidationContext) method
  3. Return proper ValidationResult objects with full metadata
  4. Use appropriate check IDs following naming conventions
  5. Integrate with ValidationEvidence and ValidationMetadata structures
  
  The validators now fully comply with the validation framework architecture and
  are ready for production use. All 10 acceptance criteria are met with comprehensive
  test coverage. The implementation demonstrates excellent code quality, proper
  error handling, and follows all project standards.
  
  Status changed from CONCERNS to PASS - Story is complete and production-ready.
