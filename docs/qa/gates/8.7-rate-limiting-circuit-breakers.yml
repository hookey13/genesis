technical_debt:
  - description: 'Method signature inconsistency between rate limiter and gateway'
    impact: 'Would cause runtime errors'
    resolution: 'Fixed during review'
  - description: 'Missing Prometheus metrics integration for alerting'
    impact: 'Cannot alert on rate limit thresholds'
    resolution: 'Should integrate with monitoring from Story 8.5'
