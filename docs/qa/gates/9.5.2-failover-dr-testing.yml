implementation_highlights:
  - Comprehensive failover orchestration with state management
  - Sophisticated health monitoring with configurable thresholds
  - Multi-region support with intelligent region selection
  - Automated DR testing framework with cron scheduling
  - Route53 DNS integration for traffic management
  - Database promotion handling for both RDS and self-managed PostgreSQL
  - Extensive notification system (Email, Slack, PagerDuty)
  - Proper async/await implementation throughout
  - Comprehensive error handling and rollback capabilities
  - Detailed metrics collection and reporting

test_quality:
  - Well-structured test suite with appropriate mocking
  - Coverage of all critical paths
  - Tests for both success and failure scenarios
  - Async test support properly implemented
  - Consider adding chaos engineering tests
  - Performance benchmarking would be valuable

security_improvements_made:
  - Removed hardcoded Slack webhook URLs from configuration
  - Removed hardcoded PagerDuty integration keys
  - Modified database connections to use environment variables for credentials
  - All sensitive data now pulled from environment variables

compliance:
  - Follows Python best practices and PEP standards
  - Proper type hints throughout codebase
  - Comprehensive logging with structured logging (structlog)
  - Error handling follows consistent patterns
  - Configuration properly externalized
