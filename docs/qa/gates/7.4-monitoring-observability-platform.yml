test_design_priorities:
  P0:  # Critical - must have
    - 'Authentication bypass attempts on metrics endpoint'
    - 'Metric injection with malicious labels'

    - 'Memory exhaustion under high load'

    - 'Capacity planning predictions'
  P2:  # Nice to have
    - 'Dashboard rendering performance'

architectural_concerns:
  - 'No separation between metrics collection and exposure layers'

  - 'No support for multi-tenancy or metric isolation'
