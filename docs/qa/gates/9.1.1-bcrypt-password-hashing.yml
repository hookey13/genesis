  strengths:
    - "Bcrypt with cost factor 12 provides excellent protection"
    - "Unique salts for each password hash"
    - "Timing-safe verification prevents timing attacks"
    - "Account locking prevents brute force attacks"
    - "Password history prevents password reuse"
    - "Secure random password generation"
    - "No password logged or exposed in errors"
    
  mitigations:

    - "Failed login tracking for security monitoring"
    - "Password reset tokens with secure generation"

# Performance considerations
performance_notes:
  - "Bcrypt cost factor 12 provides ~250ms hashing time (acceptable)"
  - "Password verification is constant time regardless of result"
  - "Migration happens lazily during user login (no bulk processing)"
  - "Efficient regex compilation for complexity validation"

# Compliance status
compliance:
  owasp: "✓ Compliant with OWASP password guidelines"
  nist: "✓ Meets NIST 800-63B requirements"
  pci_dss: "✓ Satisfies PCI DSS password requirements"
  gdpr: "✓ Password data properly protected"

# Final assessment
final_assessment: |
  This implementation demonstrates exceptional security engineering with proper
  cryptographic password management using bcrypt. The code is well-structured,
  thoroughly tested, and includes all necessary security features including
  migration path, account locking, password history, and complexity validation.
  
  The implementation goes beyond basic requirements with features like crack time
  estimation, secure password generation, and comprehensive edge case handling.
  
  No critical or high-priority issues were identified. The code is production-ready
  and represents a significant security improvement over SHA256 hashing.
