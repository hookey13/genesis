notes: |
  Story 7.10 implements a comprehensive production readiness validation framework
  that effectively addresses all 10 acceptance criteria. The implementation includes:
  
  1. Automated test coverage validation with >90% requirement enforcement
  2. Integration test suite verification  
  3. 48-hour stability testing framework
  4. Security scanning with zero critical issues requirement
  5. Performance benchmarking with <50ms p99 latency validation
  6. Disaster recovery testing framework
  7. Operations readiness checklists and training materials
  8. Paper trading profit validation ($10k threshold)
  9. Compliance and legal checklists
  10. Master go-live dashboard with color-coded status indicators
  
  Minor improvements made during review:
  - Converted subprocess.run to async subprocess calls for better async patterns
  - This improves non-blocking I/O in the validation framework
  
  The implementation is production-ready and provides comprehensive go/no-go 
  decision support for real money trading deployment.
