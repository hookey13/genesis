decision_rationale: |
  Gate status is CONCERNS rather than PASS due to the architectural issue discovered during review.
  While the issue has been resolved through refactoring, it indicates a gap in the original 
  implementation that could have caused integration problems. The refactoring ensures proper
  framework integration and maintains all functionality. All acceptance criteria are met,
  test coverage is comprehensive, and the implementation is production-ready.
