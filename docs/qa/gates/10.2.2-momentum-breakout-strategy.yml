  POST-FIX UPDATE: The developer has successfully addressed all critical issues.
  
  The implementation is now production-ready with:
  1. ✅ All security vulnerabilities resolved with comprehensive input validation
  2. ✅ 100% unit test pass rate (25/25 tests passing)
  3. ✅ All acceptance criteria fully implemented
  4. ✅ Decimal-only financial calculations confirmed
  5. ✅ Proper error handling and state management
  
  The developer demonstrated excellent responsiveness to feedback and technical skill
  in quickly resolving all identified issues. The code is now safe for production deployment.
  
  Minor architecture improvements (class splitting, caching) remain as technical debt
  but do not block production deployment. These can be addressed in future iterations.
