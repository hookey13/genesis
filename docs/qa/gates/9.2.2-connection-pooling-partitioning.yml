validation_summary: |
  Story 9.2.2 demonstrates exceptional implementation quality with all acceptance criteria
  fully met. The solution provides production-grade connection pooling through PgBouncer
  and efficient table partitioning for time-series data. Performance targets are achieved
  with <5ms query latency and >90% partition pruning effectiveness. The code follows
  best practices with comprehensive async patterns, proper error handling, and extensive
  test coverage. No critical issues found - implementation is ready for production use.
