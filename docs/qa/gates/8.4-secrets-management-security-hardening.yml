nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent security implementation with multi-backend support, proper encryption (AES-256), secure key storage, comprehensive audit logging, and zero-knowledge architecture. Pre-commit hooks prevent secret exposure.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Efficient async operations throughout, TTL-based caching reduces backend calls, background key rotation minimizes service impact.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Robust error handling with specific exceptions, dual-key rotation prevents downtime, fallback mechanisms for all backends, comprehensive test coverage.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean architecture with abstract interfaces, well-documented code, proper separation of concerns, follows all coding standards.'

  immediate: []  # No immediate fixes required
  future:
    - action: 'Add rate limiting for secret access operations'
      refs: ['genesis/security/secrets_manager.py']
      rationale: 'Prevent potential enumeration attacks on secret paths'
    - action: 'Consider implementing secret versioning UI'
      refs: ['genesis/security/secrets_manager.py']
      rationale: 'Would help with audit trail visualization and rollback capabilities'
    - action: 'Add metrics collection for secret operations'
      refs: ['genesis/security/secrets_manager.py']
      rationale: 'Would provide insights into secret usage patterns and potential issues'
