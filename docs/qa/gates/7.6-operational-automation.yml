decision_rationale: |
  The implementation is architecturally sound and feature-complete, but lacks 
  critical test coverage for self-healing and optimization functions that could 
  impact system stability and financial performance. The missing tests for 
  components that perform automated actions (health remediation, strategy 
  optimization, dependency updates) represent unacceptable risk for production 
  deployment.
