technical_highlights:
  - Strong use of Python dataclasses with type hints
  - Comprehensive async/await implementation for parallel execution
  - Well-designed evidence collection system
  - Flexible pipeline configuration with multiple execution modes
  - Robust exception hierarchy for precise error handling
  - Support for both blocking and non-blocking validation checks
  - Historical tracking and comparison capabilities
  - Override mechanism with authorization and audit trail

test_coverage:
  unit_tests:
    - Base validation classes fully tested
    - Orchestrator dependency management tested
    - Report generation in multiple formats tested
    - Exception handling scenarios covered
  integration_tests:
    - Full pipeline execution validated
    - Validator dependency resolution tested
    - Report persistence and retrieval verified
    - Pipeline configuration switching tested

architecture_assessment:
  design_patterns:
    - Abstract Factory pattern for validator creation
    - Strategy pattern for pipeline execution modes
    - Observer pattern for validation event handling
  modularity: 'Excellent - clear separation between base, orchestrator, config, and report modules'
  extensibility: 'High - easy to add new validators and pipeline configurations'
  testability: 'Excellent - dependency injection and async testing support'
