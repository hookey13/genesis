  EXCELLENT IMPLEMENTATION - The story successfully integrates all validation modules with a 
  comprehensive dashboard and decision engine. Initially identified critical security vulnerabilities 
  have been FULLY RESOLVED by the development team. The implementation now includes:
  
  1. Production-grade authentication module with bcrypt password hashing
  2. Comprehensive rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms
  3. Role-based access control (RBAC) for authorization
  4. Secure credential management with encryption and vault integration
  5. Full audit logging and session management
  
  The PASS gate reflects the successful resolution of all critical issues. The implementation
  is now production-ready with excellent security posture, comprehensive test coverage, and
  solid architecture. All 10 acceptance criteria are fully met.
