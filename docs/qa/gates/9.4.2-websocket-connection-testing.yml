# Additional notes
notes: |
  EXCELLENT IMPLEMENTATION - The WebSocket load testing framework now meets all production standards.
  
  Post-fix improvements implemented:
  1. Bearer token authentication via environment variables
  2. Comprehensive rate limiting (100/min, 10/sec) with async locking
  3. Full message validation and sanitization
  4. All code quality issues resolved (ruff and mypy pass cleanly)
  5. Modern Python 3.11+ type hints throughout
  
  The implementation provides robust load testing capabilities for validating WebSocket
  performance at scale with 10,000+ concurrent connections, comprehensive metrics,
  and chaos engineering features.
