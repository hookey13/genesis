2. Complete policy documentation gaps
3. Implement automated evidence collection
4. Establish metrics and reporting

### Short-term Actions (Priority 2)
1. Deploy DLP solution
2. Enhance monitoring capabilities
3. Conduct tabletop exercises
4. Perform gap assessment

### Long-term Actions (Priority 3)
1. Achieve ISO 27001 certification
2. Implement GRC platform
