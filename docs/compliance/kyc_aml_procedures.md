# KYC/AML Procedures

## Know Your Customer (KYC) Requirements

### Identity Verification Process

#### 1. Initial Customer Onboarding
- **Document Collection**
  - Government-issued photo ID (passport, driver's license, national ID)
  - Proof of address (utility bill, bank statement dated within 3 months)
  - Tax identification number (TIN) or equivalent
  - For institutional clients: Certificate of incorporation, authorized signatory list

#### 2. Verification Levels
- **Level 1 - Basic Verification** ($0-$10,000 monthly volume)
  - Email verification
  - Phone number verification
  - Basic identity document check

- **Level 2 - Enhanced Verification** ($10,000-$100,000 monthly volume)
  - Full document verification with liveness check
  - Address verification
  - Source of funds declaration

- **Level 3 - Full Verification** ($100,000+ monthly volume)
  - Enhanced due diligence (EDD)
  - Source of wealth verification
  - Ongoing monitoring and annual review

### Customer Risk Assessment

#### Risk Categories
1. **Low Risk**
   - Retail traders with small volumes
   - Established history with platform
   - Transparent transaction patterns

2. **Medium Risk**
   - New accounts with large initial deposits
   - Frequent large transactions
   - Cross-border activity

3. **High Risk**
   - Politically exposed persons (PEPs)
   - Accounts from high-risk jurisdictions
   - Complex ownership structures
   - Unusual transaction patterns

### Ongoing Monitoring Requirements
- Daily transaction monitoring for unusual patterns
- Monthly review of high-risk accounts
- Annual review of all active accounts
- Real-time sanctions screening

## Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Procedures

### Transaction Monitoring Rules

#### Suspicious Activity Indicators
1. **Velocity Rules**
   - More than 10 transactions per hour
   - More than 50 transactions per day
   - Rapid deposit and withdrawal cycles

2. **Volume Rules**
   - Single transaction > $50,000
   - Daily volume > $100,000
   - Monthly volume > $500,000

3. **Pattern Detection**
   - Structuring (transactions just below reporting thresholds)
   - Layering (multiple accounts, rapid transfers)
   - Round-trip transactions (deposit and immediate withdrawal)

### Suspicious Activity Detection Logic

```python
# Pseudo-code for suspicious activity detection
def detect_suspicious_activity(transaction):
    suspicious_indicators = []
    
    # Velocity checks
    if count_recent_transactions(transaction.account_id, hours=1) > 10:
        suspicious_indicators.append("HIGH_VELOCITY")
    
    # Volume checks
    if transaction.amount > 50000:
        suspicious_indicators.append("LARGE_TRANSACTION")
    
    # Pattern checks
    if is_structuring_pattern(transaction):
        suspicious_indicators.append("STRUCTURING")
    
    if is_round_trip(transaction):
        suspicious_indicators.append("ROUND_TRIP")
    
    # Geographic risk
    if transaction.country in HIGH_RISK_COUNTRIES:
        suspicious_indicators.append("HIGH_RISK_JURISDICTION")
    
    return suspicious_indicators
```

### Reporting Requirements

#### Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs)
- File within 30 days of detection
- Include all relevant transaction details
- Document investigation findings
- Maintain confidentiality (no tipping off)

#### Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs)
- Report transactions > $10,000 (or local equivalent)
- File within 15 days of transaction
- Include customer identification information

### Sanctions Screening

#### Screening Lists
- OFAC SDN List (Office of Foreign Assets Control)
- UN Security Council Sanctions List
- EU Consolidated List
- Local regulatory lists

#### Screening Process
1. **Real-time Screening**
   - Check against sanctions lists before transaction execution
   - Block transactions involving sanctioned entities
   - Generate alerts for manual review

2. **Batch Screening**
   - Daily screening of entire customer base
   - Weekly updates of sanctions lists
   - Retroactive screening after list updates

### Record Keeping Requirements

#### Retention Periods
- Customer identification records: 5 years after account closure
- Transaction records: 5 years from transaction date
- SAR documentation: 5 years from filing date
- Internal investigation records: 7 years

#### Required Records
- All customer due diligence documentation
- Transaction history and supporting documents
- Communications related to suspicious activity
- Training records and compliance testing results
