## Story 6.6: System Integration Smoke Test

As a Strategist tier trader,
I want automated integration testing before manual validation,
So that all components work together without crashes or data issues.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Component Connectivity Check**
   - All modules start without errors
   - Database connections verified across all components
   - WebSocket streams maintain stable connections
   - No memory leaks after 24-hour test run

2. **Data Flow Verification**
   - Market data flows from ingestion → strategies → execution
   - Trades log correctly to database and analytics
   - Risk calculations update in real-time
   - Performance metrics calculate without NaN/null errors

3. **Strategy Integration Test**
   - Single strategy execution end-to-end
   - Multiple strategies run without interference
   - VWAP and iceberg orders execute as configured
   - Position limits enforced across all strategies

4. **Error Recovery Testing**
   - API disconnection and auto-reconnect
   - Strategy crashes don't affect others
   - Database locks handled gracefully
   - System restart recovers all positions correctly

5. **Edge Case Validation**
   - Zero balance handling
   - Partial fills processed correctly
   - Simultaneous buy/sell signals resolved
   - Maximum position count enforcement

6. **UI Integration Check**
   - All dashboards display correct data
   - No terminal crashes on rapid updates
   - Commands execute without hanging
   - Performance stats match database records

7. **Critical Path Test**
   - Place order → execute → track → close → analyse
   - Each tier's features accessible when conditions met
   - Risk limits prevent over-leverage
   - Emergency stop halts everything cleanly

8. **Pre-Production Checklist**
   - All unit tests pass
   - Integration test suite green
   - 48-hour stability test completed
   - Test account shows expected P&L calculations
