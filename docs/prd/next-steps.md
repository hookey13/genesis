- Operational automation and runbooks
- Alert configuration and PagerDuty integration

**Phase 3: Resilience & Recovery (Week 5-6)**
- Automated backup and disaster recovery
- Stress testing and chaos engineering
- Compliance reporting framework
- Performance optimization

**Phase 4: Final Validation (Week 7-8)**
- 48-hour continuous operation test
- Security audit and penetration testing
- Production readiness checklist completion
- Go-live preparation and rollout plan

## UX Expert Prompt

"Review the Project GENESIS PRD focusing on the terminal-based 'Digital Zen Garden' interface design. Create detailed wireframes for the three-panel layout (P&L, Positions, Commands) with special attention to the psychological aspects: color psychology for anti-tilt design, progressive disclosure by tier, and error message presentation. Consider how visual hierarchy and information density change between Sniper ($500), Hunter ($2k), and Strategist ($10k) tiers. Document the command syntax and autocomplete behavior. Pay particular attention to how tilt warning indicators manifest visually without triggering panic."

## Architect Prompt

"Design the technical architecture for Project GENESIS using the PRD as foundation. Focus on the evolutionary architecture that transforms from monolith (Python/SQLite) to service-oriented (Python/Rust/PostgreSQL) as capital grows. Address the critical <100ms execution requirement, tier-locked feature system implementation, and real-time tilt detection algorithms. Special attention needed for: state management across tiers, WebSocket connection resilience, order slicing algorithms, and the correlation calculation engine. Provide deployment architecture for DigitalOcean Singapore with failover planning. Document how the system enforces tier restrictions at the code level to prevent override attempts."

## DevOps Engineer Prompt

"Implement Epic 7's production deployment infrastructure for Project GENESIS. Create Docker multi-stage builds, Kubernetes manifests, and Terraform IaC for cloud deployment. Design the monitoring stack with Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK. Implement zero-downtime blue-green deployments with automated rollback. Configure HashiCorp Vault for secrets management. Set up disaster recovery with cross-region backups to S3. Ensure 99.9% uptime SLA with comprehensive alerting. Document runbooks for the top 20 failure scenarios."
