# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Execute trades automatically without manual intervention 95% of the time through tier-locked evolution system
- Successfully navigate the $2k-10k "execution valley of death" that destroys 90% of profitable strategies
- Achieve consistent 5-10% monthly returns while maintaining maximum 15% drawdown limit
- Reach $100k within 18-24 months through disciplined compound growth from $500 starting capital
- Enforce systematic discipline during emotional moments and drawdowns through automated guardrails
- Maintain 99.5% system uptime during market hours with robust infrastructure

**Tier Transition Success Gates:**

**Sniper Tier ($500-$2,000) → Hunter Tier Gate Requirements:**
- Minimum 30 days at current tier before transition eligible
- Demonstrated 60% profitable days over last 20 trading days
- Maximum position size discipline: Zero violations of 5% rule in past 14 days
- Execution proficiency: 90% of trades executed within 100ms target
- Risk compliance: No drawdowns exceeding 10% in transition month
- Pair graduation: Successfully traded 3+ different pairs profitably
- **Lock Criteria:** System auto-locks Hunter features until ALL gates passed

**Hunter Tier ($2,000-$10,000) → Strategist Tier Gate Requirements:**
- Minimum 45 days at Hunter tier for strategy maturation
- Consistent slicing execution: 95% of orders >$200 use 3+ slices
- Portfolio diversification: Active positions across 5+ uncorrelated pairs
- Drawdown recovery: Demonstrated recovery from one 10%+ drawdown
- Volume analysis proficiency: No market impact >0.5% on any trade
- Risk-adjusted returns: Sharpe ratio >1.5 over past 30 days
- **Lock Criteria:** VWAP/iceberg algorithms remain disabled until gates cleared

**Strategist Tier ($10,000-$50,000) → Architect Tier Gate Requirements:**
- Minimum 60 days of Strategist-level operation
- Multi-strategy validation: 3+ concurrent strategies profitable
- Correlation management: No strategy >40% of total P&L
- Stress test survival: Paper-tested through 3 historical crash scenarios
- Infrastructure redundancy: Backup systems tested under fire
- Institutional discipline: 30 consecutive days without manual override
- **Lock Criteria:** Advanced features locked until psychological evaluation passed

**Emergency Demotion Triggers (Automatic Tier Downgrade):**
- Any single day loss >15% of account
- Three consecutive days of >5% losses
- Five override attempts within 24 hours
- Manual execution attempts bypassing system
- Correlation spike: All positions moving same direction >80%
- Infrastructure failure causing >$500 loss

## Background Context

Project GENESIS addresses a critical gap in the cryptocurrency trading landscape where Binance processes $50+ billion daily yet thousands of sub-$1M volume trading pairs contain persistent inefficiencies generating 2-5% spreads. These opportunities exist because institutional traders cannot profitably deploy capital below $100k volumes while retail traders lack the speed and infrastructure to capture fleeting arbitrage windows. The system specifically targets the $2-10k "execution valley of death" where manual methods fail and sophisticated execution algorithms become necessary, implementing a Tier-Locked Evolution System that automatically adapts strategies, risk parameters, and psychological frameworks as capital grows.

The core innovation is the Three-Layer Transformation Protocol combining technical evolution (automated execution changes), psychological safeguards (dollar-focused metrics), and strategic migration (enforced pair discovery). Unlike traditional bots applying uniform logic regardless of account size, GENESIS physically prevents behaviors that worked at lower tiers from destroying higher-tier capital, forcing adoption of appropriate slicing algorithms, position sizing, and risk management at each growth stage.
