# Epic 4: Hunter Tier Evolution & Execution Algorithms ($2k-$5k capability)

**Goal:** Develop sophisticated execution algorithms and multi-pair trading capabilities required for Hunter tier success. Enable smooth progression from Sniper to Hunter with automated strategy evolution and enhanced order management.

## Story 4.1: Iceberg Order Execution
As a Hunter tier trader,
I want orders automatically sliced to avoid market impact,
so that I can trade larger positions without moving prices.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Automatic slicing for orders >$200 (3 minimum slices)
2. Smart slice sizing based on order book depth
3. Random time delays between slices (1-5 seconds)
4. Slice size variation to avoid detection (Â±20%)
5. Market impact monitoring per slice
6. Abort if slippage exceeds 0.5%
7. Completion tracking and reporting
8. Rollback capability for partially filled orders

## Story 4.2: Multi-Pair Concurrent Trading
As a diversifying trader,
I want to trade multiple pairs simultaneously,
so that I can spread risk and capture more opportunities.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Support for 5+ concurrent positions
2. Per-pair position limits enforced
3. Overall portfolio risk management
4. Correlation monitoring between positions
5. Smart capital allocation across pairs
6. Queue management for competing signals
7. Priority system for high-confidence trades
8. Performance attribution by pair

## Story 4.3: TWAP Execution Algorithm
As a price-sensitive trader,
I want time-weighted average price execution,
so that I can achieve better average entry prices.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. TWAP over configurable time window (5-30 minutes)
2. Adaptive slice timing based on volume patterns
3. Participation rate limiting (max 10% of volume)
4. Benchmark tracking vs arrival price
5. Early completion on favorable prices
6. Pause/resume capability
7. Real-time progress visualization
8. Post-trade execution analysis

## Story 4.4: Tier Transition Gateway System
As a graduating trader,
I want automated tier transitions with safety checks,
so that I progress smoothly without manual errors.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Gate requirement tracking dashboard
2. Automatic feature unlocking on gate completion
3. Tier demotion triggers monitored
4. Transition ceremony interface
5. Feature tutorial for newly unlocked capabilities
6. Rollback protection (no manual tier changes)
7. Grace period for adjustment (48 hours)
8. Historical transition log

## Story 4.5: Smart Order Routing
As an efficiency-focused trader,
I want intelligent order type selection,
so that I get best execution for market conditions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Automatic market vs limit order decision
2. Spread-based routing logic
3. Liquidity-based execution choice
4. Time-of-day optimization
5. Maker/taker fee optimization
6. Post-only order usage when appropriate
7. FOK/IOC order type selection
8. Execution quality scoring
