## Top Issues by Priority

**BLOCKERS:** None identified

**HIGH PRIORITY:**
1. **Testing Strategy Gap** - While testing requirements mentioned, no formal test automation strategy or CI/CD pipeline definition
2. **Disaster Recovery Procedures** - Critical for financial system but only briefly mentioned
3. **Data Migration Strategy** - How to migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL at $2k not detailed

**MEDIUM PRIORITY:**
1. **Schema Evolution Plan** - Database changes as system grows need planning
2. **Backup Verification Process** - Backups mentioned but not verification procedures
3. **Integration Test Environment** - No mention of Binance testnet usage strategy

**LOW PRIORITY:**
1. **Documentation Standards** - Code documentation approach not specified
2. **Performance Profiling Tools** - Monitoring mentioned but not profiling approach
3. **Log Aggregation Details** - Logging strategy needs more specificity

## Final Decision

**âœ… READY FOR ARCHITECT**

The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design. The identified gaps are implementation details that can be addressed during architecture phase rather than blocking concerns. The psychological sophistication and tier evolution approach provide exceptional foundation for a trading system that could actually survive the valley of death.
