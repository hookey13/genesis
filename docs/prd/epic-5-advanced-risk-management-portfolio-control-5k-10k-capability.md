6. Correlation impact on new trades (pre-trade)
7. Stress testing under correlation spikes
8. Visual correlation heatmap

## Story 5.2: Dynamic Position Sizing

3. Win rate and edge estimation
4. Dynamic adjustment based on recent performance
5. Override for high-conviction trades
6. Minimum/maximum position boundaries
7. Volatility-adjusted sizing
8. Monte Carlo simulation for validation

## Story 5.3: Drawdown Recovery Protocol
As a trader in drawdown,
I want systematic recovery procedures,
so that I can rebuild without revenge trading.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Automatic detection of 10%+ drawdown
2. Position size reduction to 50%

As a return-seeking trader,
I want optimal capital allocation across strategies,
so that I maximize risk-adjusted returns.

2. Efficient frontier analysis
3. Dynamic rebalancing triggers
4. Transaction cost consideration
5. Minimum allocation thresholds
6. Strategy correlation in optimization
7. Out-of-sample validation
8. Weekly rebalancing recommendations

## Story 5.5: Emergency Risk Controls

I want circuit breakers for extreme events,
so that I preserve capital during black swans.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Automatic halt on 15% daily loss
2. Correlation spike emergency response
