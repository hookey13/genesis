# Epic 3: Psychological Safeguards & Tilt Detection ($1k-$2k capability)

**Goal:** Implement comprehensive behavioral monitoring and intervention systems that prevent emotional trading. Create the psychological infrastructure that detects tilt before it causes damage and enforces discipline during the critical valley of death transition.

## Story 3.1: Behavioral Baseline Establishment
As a self-aware trader,
I want the system to learn my normal trading patterns,
so that it can detect when I'm deviating due to emotion.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. 30-day baseline period for pattern learning
2. Metrics tracked: click speed, order frequency, position sizes, cancel rates
3. Time-of-day pattern analysis
4. Personal "normal" ranges calculated per metric
5. Baseline adjustment algorithm (rolling 7-day window)
6. Manual baseline reset capability
7. Export baseline data for analysis
8. Multiple baseline profiles (tired/alert/stressed)

## Story 3.2: Multi-Level Tilt Detection System
As an emotional human,
I want early warning of tilt behavior,
so that I can correct before causing damage.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Level 1 detection: 2-3 behavioral anomalies (yellow border)
2. Level 2 detection: 4-5 anomalies (orange border, reduced sizing)
3. Level 3 detection: 6+ anomalies (trading lockout)
4. Progressive intervention messages (supportive, not shaming)
5. Real-time tilt score calculation (<50ms)
6. Pattern detection: revenge trading, position size volatility
7. Physical behavior tracking: typing speed, mouse patterns
8. Tilt history log with triggering events

## Story 3.3: Intervention & Recovery Protocols
As a tilt-prone trader,
I want structured recovery processes,
so that I can safely return to trading after emotional episodes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Graduated lockout periods (5min/30min/24hr)
2. Journal entry requirement for Level 3 recovery
3. Reduced position sizes on re-entry (25% to start)
4. Meditation timer integration (optional)
5. Performance comparison: tilted vs calm trading
6. Recovery checklist before trading resumption
7. "Tilt debt" system requiring profitable trades to clear
8. Emergency contact option (future: family notification)

## Story 3.4: Micro-Behavior Analytics
As a trader seeking self-improvement,
I want detailed behavioral analytics,
so that I can understand my emotional patterns.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Click-to-trade latency tracking and analysis
2. Order modification frequency monitoring
3. Tab-switching pattern detection
4. "Stare time" measurement (inactivity periods)
5. Configuration change tracking
6. Session length analysis
7. Correlation between behaviors and P&L
8. Weekly behavioral report generation

## Story 3.5: Valley of Death Transition Guard
As a trader approaching the $2k threshold,
I want special protection during tier transition,
so that I don't destroy my account during the critical evolution.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Heightened monitoring starting at $1,800

3. Forced paper trading of new execution methods
4. Psychological preparation checklist
