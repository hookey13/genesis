## Notes

This epic represents the final transformation from a functional trading system to a production-grade operation. Every story is designed to prevent the catastrophic failures that destroy trading accounts: connection losses leading to runaway positions, security breaches exposing API keys, or operational failures during critical market moves. The system must be boring, reliable, and predictable - excitement in production operations means something is wrong.

The production deployment is not just about going live - it's about staying live through exchange outages, network failures, and 3 AM emergencies while protecting capital with the same discipline the trading logic enforces.
