# Tech Stack

This is the DEFINITIVE technology selection for Project GENESIS. Every choice here directly impacts our ability to survive the valley of death and reach $100k. These decisions are final and all other documentation must reference these exact versions.

## Cloud Infrastructure

- **Provider:** DigitalOcean
- **Key Services:** Droplets (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS), Spaces (S3-compatible backup)
- **Deployment Regions:** Singapore (SGP1 - primary, closest to Binance)

## Phased Technology Evolution

**Phase 1: MVP ($500-$2k)**
- Pure Python with asyncio - no external state management
- SQLite with Alembic for future migration path
- In-memory everything (dicts, queues, calculations)
- Structured logging to files with log rotation
- Automated backups every 4 hours with restic

**Phase 2: Hunter ($2k-$10k)**
- Add Redis for multi-pair state management
- Migrate to PostgreSQL (via Alembic migrations)
- Keep JSON serialization (it's working)
- Basic monitoring with log aggregation

**Phase 3: Strategist ($10k+)**
- Consider Rust for execution engine
- Add Prometheus/Grafana for observability
- MessagePack if event volume demands it
- Full infrastructure automation with Terraform
