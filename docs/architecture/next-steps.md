# Next Steps

## Immediate Next Steps (Before Development)

1. **Review Architecture with Fresh Eyes**
2. **Set Up Development Environment**
3. **Create Critical Path First**

## Development Phase Checkpoints

**Week 1-2: Foundation**
**Week 3-4: Trading Core**
**Week 5-6: Safety Systems**
**Week 7-8: Terminal UI**

## Pre-Launch Checklist

- [ ] 48 hours paper trading profitable
